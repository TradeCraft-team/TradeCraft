Possible Issues:
- check disconnect activities: disconnected but not deleted from room
  - third user enters the same first room while the first two did not see new player. (login logic problem)


[DONE] LOGIN logic:
  login
  uname_old (read from session)
  username (read from webpage input)

  - uname_old => player => active
  - username => player => active
         ==> username / session_id conflict
  - username => player => not active
         ==> reconnect
  - others
         ==> normal login


- [DONE] game capacity problems: more than max persons?

## Reconnections. [LATER]

## Tag loading
- [TODO] check auto tag-load behavior: whne loading, the coefficient may keep changing
- Multiple extra visits and runnings (30x or more) of getting tags on webpage. Find reason. This could make things very slow.
