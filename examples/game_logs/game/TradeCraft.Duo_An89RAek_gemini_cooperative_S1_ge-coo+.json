And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not.

The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over.

  "msg": "{\"text\":\"# Game Setting.\\nYou and your teamates are playing a game called **tradeCraft**, here is the game introduction.  \\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# üèÜ **Winning Condition**\\n1.Focus on crafting your target item as efficiently as possible.\\n2.Support your opponent‚Äôs progress through information-sharing and fair trade.\\n\\n# üå± **Strategy Tips**\\n1. Prioritize trades that create mutual benefit, even at short-term cost to yourself. In this mode, winning requires that both sides progress.\\n2. Openly share insights about item chains, crafting routes, and inferred goals. If you notice the other side may be stuck, offer clues or relevant resources to assist them.\\n3. Transparency and goodwill are essential ‚Äî unlike in competitive play, where bluffing, misdirection, and information hoarding are common tactics, this mode thrives on honest cooperation and trust-building.\\n4. In many other games, teams may deceive, bait, or manipulate their opponents to gain an edge. But here, such tactics undermine collective success. Replace bluffing with clarity, replace probing for secrets with volunteering support.\\n5. Think of your team and the other as allies bound by shared fate: coordination, empathy, and shared planning are your strongest weapons.\\nü§ù ‚ÄúTo win alone is to lose together.

  "msg": "{\"text\":\"# Game Setting.\\nYou and your teamates are playing a game called **tradeCraft**, here is the game introduction.  \\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# üèÜ **Winning Condition**\\n1.Focus on crafting your target item as efficiently as possible.\\n2.Support your opponent‚Äôs progress through information-sharing and fair trade.\\n\\n# üå± **Strategy Tips**\\n1. Prioritize trades that create mutual benefit, even at short-term cost to yourself. In this mode, winning requires that both sides progress.\\n2. Openly share insights about item chains, crafting routes, and inferred goals. If you notice the other side may be stuck, offer clues or relevant resources to assist them.\\n3. Transparency and goodwill are essential ‚Äî unlike in competitive play, where bluffing, misdirection, and information hoarding are common tactics, this mode thrives on honest cooperation and trust-building.\\n4. In many other games, teams may deceive, bait, or manipulate their opponents to gain an edge. But here, such tactics undermine collective success. Replace bluffing with clarity, replace probing for secrets with volunteering support.\\n5. Think of your team and the other as allies bound by shared fate: coordination, empathy, and shared planning are your strongest weapons.\\nü§ù ‚ÄúTo win alone is to lose together. To win together is the only victory that matters.‚Äù\\n\\nYour teams's username is **gemini_cooperative**.\\nYour are the **proposer** in your team: who would start a proposal at the beginning of each turn. \\nYou should stick to your **wining condition** and **strategy tips**\\n\\n# The task:\\nYou should make a proper proposal.\\nA proposal is made up of 4 parts:\\n- another playe to trade with,\\n- what you want to **offer** to the other player, format: `{item:amount}`,\\n- what you want to **request** to the other plater, format: `{item:amount}`,\\n- a text-based message you want to send to player, trying to persuade her / him to accept this proposal.\\n*This message should reflect your team's winning strategy.*\\n*Always align your entire proposal ‚Äî including player choice, offer/request items, and message tone ‚Äî with your team‚Äôs **winning condition** and **strategy tips**.*\\n\\nUse *Final Output:* to tell what you want to submit as your proposal, write in in JSON format.\\n\\n# Important Tips\\nplayer ID Validity:\\n- When filling in the `\\\"player\\\"` field of your proposal, **you must use the correct and valid opponent ID**.\\n- In this game, the only valid trading player for you is: **gemini_competitive**.\\n- Do not use an incorrect or non-existent player ID (e.g., `\\\"agent_1\\\"`) will cause your proposal to be rejected.\\nMake sure to **double-check** the `\\\"player\\\"` field in your final output.\\n\\n# Useable Tools\\nWhile doing you job you have the following tools:\\nitem_info - Get crafting recipes related to `item_name`.\\n        The return is in format of a string.\\n        First line of return is the recipes which can output the item ({input: ingredients, output: results}),\\n        each item is given as `item_name:item_value` pair, where item_value is a fraction of form {n: number, d: number}\\n        where n s numerator and d represents denominator.\\n        Second line of the return is the recipes where item can be used as input.\\n\\n        Args:\\n            messages:str = \\\"item_name\\\"\\nrethink(messages: str) - Dummy Tool\\n\\nA tool which can buy you another round to rethink.\\nIt accepts any string for inupt and outputs empty string.\\n\\nArgs:\\nmessages = \\\"any string\\\"\\n\\n\\n# Before you act:\\nAt every step, especially when writing a Thought or taking an Action, **recall your winning strategy** ‚Äî your behavior should serve that strategy.\\n\\n# Game log:\\nHere is major events happened in the game:\\n#### Updating Hand Changes of **ALL** Players\\n\\nHand items has been updated for player **gemini_cooperative**, now player **gemini_cooperative** has:\\n  - minecraft:cherry_planks: 1\\n  - minecraft:coal: 1\\n  - minecraft:cobblestone: 1\\n  - minecraft:iron_ingot: 1\\n  - minecraft:raw_copper: 1\\n\\n\\nHand items has been updated for player **gemini_competitive**, now player **gemini_competitive** has:\\n  - minecraft:cobblestone: 1\\n  - minecraft:oak_planks: 1\\n  - minecraft:raw_copper: 2\\n  - minecraft:raw_iron: 5\\n\\n\\nThe TradeCraft game is about to begin!\\nYour username is **gemini_cooperative**.\\n\\n# Goal\\n    Attention!

In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe.

  "msg": "{\"text\":\"# Game Setting.\\nYou and your teamates are playing a game called **tradeCraft**, here is the game introduction.  \\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# üèÜ **Winning Condition**\\n1.Focus on crafting your target item as efficiently as possible.\\n2.Support your opponent‚Äôs progress through information-sharing and fair trade.\\n\\n# üå± **Strategy Tips**\\n1.

Transparency and goodwill are essential ‚Äî unlike in competitive play, where bluffing, misdirection, and information hoarding are common tactics, this mode thrives on honest cooperation and trust-building.\\n4. In many other games, teams may deceive, bait, or manipulate their opponents to gain an edge. But here, such tactics undermine collective success.

  "msg": "{\"text\":\"You together with your team is playing a game called **tradeCraft**. Your team's username is **gemini_cooperative**.\\n\\n# Game introduction\\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# üèÜ **Winning Condition**\\n1.Focus on crafting your target item as efficiently as possible.\\n2.Support your opponent‚Äôs progress through information-sharing and fair trade.\\n\\n# üå± **Strategy Tips**\\n1. Prioritize trades that create mutual benefit, even at short-term cost to yourself. In this mode, winning requires that both sides progress.\\n2. Openly share insights about item chains, crafting routes, and inferred goals. If you notice the other side may be stuck, offer clues or relevant resources to assist them.\\n3. Transparency and goodwill are essential ‚Äî unlike in competitive play, where bluffing, misdirection, and information hoarding are common tactics, this mode thrives on honest cooperation and trust-building.\\n4. In many other games, teams may deceive, bait, or manipulate their opponents to gain an edge. But here, such tactics undermine collective success. Replace bluffing with clarity, replace probing for secrets with volunteering support.\\n5. Think of your team and the other as allies bound by shared fate: coordination, empathy, and shared planning are your strongest weapons.\\nü§ù ‚ÄúTo win alone is to lose together. To win together is the only victory that matters.‚Äù\\n\\n# Your task:\\n(1) You must **make a plan** for this round, where your immediate goal is to handle the task of **crafting**.\\n(2) You may predict what will happen and think about the best strategy to win. \\n(3) You have your old plan for reference. REMEMBER, **you are planning**, so you may ask for information, but not able to make a proposal / make a decision or do a crafting. \\n(4) And in the output plan, you should use symbol **<current status>** to annotate the border between true game history and the plan / prediction. \\n\\n# Useable tools:\\npossible_recipes_from_hand - Get the list of possible craft recipes affordable by your hand resources.\\n\\n        Args:\\n            messages:dict = {\\\"username\\\": your username}\\nitem_info - Get crafting recipes related to `item_name`.\\n        The return is in format of a string.\\n        First line of return is the recipes which can output the item ({input: ingredients, output: results}),\\n        each item is given as `item_name:item_value` pair, where item_value is a fraction of form {n: number, d: number}\\n        where n s numerator and d represents denominator.\\n        Second line of the return is the recipes where item can be used as input.\\n\\n        Args:\\n            messages:str = \\\"item_name\\\"\\nrethink(messages: str) - Dummy Tool\\n\\nA tool which can buy you another round to rethink.\\nIt accepts any string for inupt and outputs empty string.\\n\\nArgs:\\nmessages = \\\"any string\\\"\\n\\n# Instructions\\n[Important Note 1] In this game, **the amount of the items are important**, you must take care of the exact amount of each item you need in the plan. You may plan by answering the following questions:\\n1. What is my target. What does each player have in hand?\\n2. What are possible ways to craft the target, based on items in all player's hands, how many do I need? Is it still possible for me to craft?\\n3. What must I trade from other players, trade with which item and how many.\\n4. What might other players' targets be? What might others think?\\n5. How to avoid other players' obtaining the target before me?\\n6. How would I use the items?

Always substitute it with items like `\\\"coal\\\": 0.125` or `\\\"cherry_planks\\\": 0.667`.\\n- Similarly, if a recipe uses `#minecraft:planks`, and you hold `cherry_planks`, you may use it directly as input.\\n2Ôºâ Strict Recipe Matching:\\n- You must use **the exact input/output ratio** as defined in the recipe. For example, if crafting sticks requires:\\n  - `\\\"input\\\": \\\"#planks\\\": 2, \\\"output\\\": \\\"stick\\\": 4\\\"`, then don't use 1 plank and expecting 2 sticks.\\n- **Do not downscale or fraction the recipe arbitrarily.** Always follow integral crafting rules as listed in item info and recipe outputs.\\n\\n\\n# Old Plan:\\nHere is the plan you made last time, for your reference: \\nno plan\\n\\nWhen you make a plan, focus on the items you already have, as well as **the items you are targeting**,to make a plan.Now, start making your plan for this turn!\\n\\n\",\"type\":\"StringPromptValue\"}",

In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# üèÜ **Winning Condition**\\n1.Focus on crafting your target item as efficiently as possible.\\n2.Support your opponent‚Äôs progress through information-sharing and fair trade.\\n\\n# üå± **Strategy Tips**\\n1. Prioritize trades that create mutual benefit, even at short-term cost to yourself. In this mode, winning requires that both sides progress.\\n2. Openly share insights about item chains, crafting routes, and inferred goals. If you notice the other side may be stuck, offer clues or relevant resources to assist them.\\n3. Transparency and goodwill are essential ‚Äî unlike in competitive play, where bluffing, misdirection, and information hoarding are common tactics, this mode thrives on honest cooperation and trust-building.\\n4. In many other games, teams may deceive, bait, or manipulate their opponents to gain an edge. But here, such tactics undermine collective success. Replace bluffing with clarity, replace probing for secrets with volunteering support.\\n5. Think of your team and the other as allies bound by shared fate: coordination, empathy, and shared planning are your strongest weapons.\\nü§ù ‚ÄúTo win alone is to lose together.

  "msg": "{\"text\":\"You together with your team is playing a game called **tradeCraft**. Your team's username is **gemini_cooperative**.\\n\\n# Game introduction\\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# üèÜ **Winning Condition**\\n1.Focus on crafting your target item as efficiently as possible.\\n2.Support your opponent‚Äôs progress through information-sharing and fair trade.\\n\\n# üå± **Strategy Tips**\\n1.

  "msg": "{\"text\":\"You together with your team is playing a game called **tradeCraft**. Your team's username is **gemini_cooperative**.\\n\\n# Game introduction\\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# üèÜ **Winning Condition**\\n1.Focus on crafting your target item as efficiently as possible.\\n2.Support your opponent‚Äôs progress through information-sharing and fair trade.\\n\\n# üå± **Strategy Tips**\\n1. Prioritize trades that create mutual benefit, even at short-term cost to yourself. In this mode, winning requires that both sides progress.\\n2. Openly share insights about item chains, crafting routes, and inferred goals. If you notice the other side may be stuck, offer clues or relevant resources to assist them.\\n3. Transparency and goodwill are essential ‚Äî unlike in competitive play, where bluffing, misdirection, and information hoarding are common tactics, this mode thrives on honest cooperation and trust-building.\\n4. In many other games, teams may deceive, bait, or manipulate their opponents to gain an edge. But here, such tactics undermine collective success. Replace bluffing with clarity, replace probing for secrets with volunteering support.\\n5. Think of your team and the other as allies bound by shared fate: coordination, empathy, and shared planning are your strongest weapons.\\nü§ù ‚ÄúTo win alone is to lose together. To win together is the only victory that matters.‚Äù\\n\\n# Your task:\\n(1) You must **make a plan** for this round, where your immediate goal is to handle the task of **crafting**.\\n(2) You may predict what will happen and think about the best strategy to win. \\n(3) You have your old plan for reference. REMEMBER, **you are planning**, so you may ask for information, but not able to make a proposal / make a decision or do a crafting. \\n(4) And in the output plan, you should use symbol **<current status>** to annotate the border between true game history and the plan / prediction. \\n\\n# Useable tools:\\npossible_recipes_from_hand - Get the list of possible craft recipes affordable by your hand resources.\\n\\n        Args:\\n            messages:dict = {\\\"username\\\": your username}\\nitem_info - Get crafting recipes related to `item_name`.\\n        The return is in format of a string.\\n        First line of return is the recipes which can output the item ({input: ingredients, output: results}),\\n        each item is given as `item_name:item_value` pair, where item_value is a fraction of form {n: number, d: number}\\n        where n s numerator and d represents denominator.\\n        Second line of the return is the recipes where item can be used as input.\\n\\n        Args:\\n            messages:str = \\\"item_name\\\"\\nrethink(messages: str) - Dummy Tool\\n\\nA tool which can buy you another round to rethink.\\nIt accepts any string for inupt and outputs empty string.\\n\\nArgs:\\nmessages = \\\"any string\\\"\\n\\n# Instructions\\n[Important Note 1] In this game, **the amount of the items are important**, you must take care of the exact amount of each item you need in the plan. You may plan by answering the following questions:\\n1. What is my target. What does each player have in hand?\\n2. What are possible ways to craft the target, based on items in all player's hands, how many do I need? Is it still possible for me to craft?\\n3. What must I trade from other players, trade with which item and how many.\\n4. What might other players' targets be? What might others think?\\n5. How to avoid other players' obtaining the target before me?\\n6. How would I use the items?

You should:\\n- Focus on the most recent player actions and state updates.\\n- Ignore repeated or irrelevant exchanges.\\n- Pay attention to any item changes, successful trades, and crafting results.\\n- Note that the entire observation is time-ordered: it starts from the beginning of the game and ends at the current turn.\\n## Special tips\\n1Ôºâ Tag Resolution:\\n- **Tags like `minecraft:fuel` or `minecraft:planks` are *not actual items*** ‚Äî they are *categories* used in recipes.\\n- You must **replace any tag** with a valid item from your own hand that belongs to that tag.  \\n    - For example:  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1` = `coal * 1.0` = `cherry_planks * 16/3`  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1/8` = `coal * 0.125` = `cherry_planks * 2/3`\\n- **Never submit a recipe with `\\\"minecraft:fuel\\\"` as an input**. Always substitute it with items like `\\\"coal\\\": 0.125` or `\\\"cherry_planks\\\": 0.667`.\\n- Similarly, if a recipe uses `#minecraft:planks`, and you hold `cherry_planks`, you may use it directly as input.\\n2Ôºâ Strict Recipe Matching:\\n- You must use **the exact input/output ratio** as defined in the recipe. For example, if crafting sticks requires:\\n  - `\\\"input\\\": \\\"#planks\\\": 2, \\\"output\\\": \\\"stick\\\": 4\\\"`, then don't use 1 plank and expecting 2 sticks.\\n- **Do not downscale or fraction the recipe arbitrarily.** Always follow integral crafting rules as listed in item info and recipe outputs.\\n\\n\\n# Old Plan:\\nHere is the plan you made last time, for your reference: \\nno plan\\n\\nWhen you make a plan, focus on the items you already have, as well as **the items you are targeting**,to make a plan.Now, start making your plan for this turn!\\nParsing LLM output produced both a final answer and a parse-able action:: Thought: My target is shears, which requires 2 iron ingots.

If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server.

You should:\\n- Focus on the most recent player actions and state updates.\\n- Ignore repeated or irrelevant exchanges.\\n- Pay attention to any item changes, successful trades, and crafting results.\\n- Note that the entire observation is time-ordered: it starts from the beginning of the game and ends at the current turn.\\n## Special tips\\n1Ôºâ Tag Resolution:\\n- **Tags like `minecraft:fuel` or `minecraft:planks` are *not actual items*** ‚Äî they are *categories* used in recipes.\\n- You must **replace any tag** with a valid item from your own hand that belongs to that tag.  \\n    - For example:  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1` = `coal * 1.0` = `cherry_planks * 16/3`  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1/8` = `coal * 0.125` = `cherry_planks * 2/3`\\n- **Never submit a recipe with `\\\"minecraft:fuel\\\"` as an input**. Always substitute it with items like `\\\"coal\\\": 0.125` or `\\\"cherry_planks\\\": 0.667`.\\n- Similarly, if a recipe uses `#minecraft:planks`, and you hold `cherry_planks`, you may use it directly as input.\\n2Ôºâ Strict Recipe Matching:\\n- You must use **the exact input/output ratio** as defined in the recipe. For example, if crafting sticks requires:\\n  - `\\\"input\\\": \\\"#planks\\\": 2, \\\"output\\\": \\\"stick\\\": 4\\\"`, then don't use 1 plank and expecting 2 sticks.\\n- **Do not downscale or fraction the recipe arbitrarily.** Always follow integral crafting rules as listed in item info and recipe outputs.\\n\\n\\n# Old Plan:\\nHere is the plan you made last time, for your reference: \\nno plan\\n\\nWhen you make a plan, focus on the items you already have, as well as **the items you are targeting**,to make a plan.Now, start making your plan for this turn!\\nParsing LLM output produced both a final answer and a parse-able action:: Thought: My target is shears, which requires 2 iron ingots.

  "msg": "{\"text\":\"# Game Setting.\\nYou and your teamates are playing a game called **tradeCraft**, here is the game introduction.  \\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# üèÜ **Winning Condition**\\n1.Focus on crafting your target item as efficiently as possible.\\n2.Support your opponent‚Äôs progress through information-sharing and fair trade.\\n\\n# üå± **Strategy Tips**\\n1. Prioritize trades that create mutual benefit, even at short-term cost to yourself. In this mode, winning requires that both sides progress.\\n2. Openly share insights about item chains, crafting routes, and inferred goals. If you notice the other side may be stuck, offer clues or relevant resources to assist them.\\n3. Transparency and goodwill are essential ‚Äî unlike in competitive play, where bluffing, misdirection, and information hoarding are common tactics, this mode thrives on honest cooperation and trust-building.\\n4. In many other games, teams may deceive, bait, or manipulate their opponents to gain an edge. But here, such tactics undermine collective success. Replace bluffing with clarity, replace probing for secrets with volunteering support.\\n5. Think of your team and the other as allies bound by shared fate: coordination, empathy, and shared planning are your strongest weapons.\\nü§ù ‚ÄúTo win alone is to lose together.

Your team's username name is **gemini_cooperative**.\\nIn this game, crafting follows strictly rule set of *MineCraft*, all ingredients are required, but all related infrastructures are given.\\n\\n# Instructions\\nYou may act following the next steps: \\nstep 1. identify what items should be crafted for your final **winning condition** in your current turn according to history and current state.  \\nstep 2. from the **current state** section, extract YOUR latest hand items.  \\nstep 3. make a detailed plan about what to craft step by step, including in each step what recipes must be used and specify input / output items with their amount. Make sure you follow the guidance of **Special Tips**. You may use tools to help you know what could be crafted and the crafting properties of each item.  \\nstep 4. follow your plan step by step, using correct recipes and assign exact amount of the input / output items. While crafting each item, use tool \\\"craft_recipe_check\\\" to check for recipe correctedness, you may repeatedly checking until it is correct, then use tool \\\"craft_recipe_apply\\\" to apply it.  \\nstep 5. if target is done or mistakes happens, try to run step 3 and step 4, if a repeat does not work, return with \\\"craft_done\\\" and an error message, try to find another strategy to win the game.\\n\\nUse *Final Output:* to tell that you are done with all crafts in this turn.\\n\\n\\n# Strategic Reminder  \\nAt **every step**, especially when writing a *Thought* or deciding what to craft, **always recall your team's winning condition and strategy tips**.  \\nYour crafting plan should **serve the exact goals defined in your current game mode**: whether it is cooperation, competition, or pure self-optimization.  \\nLet your **reasoning, material prioritization, and crafting sequence** all align with your winning logic.\\n\\n## Special tips\\n1Ôºâ Tag Resolution:\\n- **Tags like `minecraft:fuel` or `minecraft:planks` are *not actual items*** ‚Äî they are *categories* used in recipes.\\n- You must **replace any tag** with a valid item from your own hand that belongs to that tag.  \\n    - For example:  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1` = `coal * 1.0` = `cherry_planks * 16/3`  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1/8` = `coal * 0.125` = `cherry_planks * 2/3`\\n- **Never submit a recipe with `\\\"minecraft:fuel\\\"` as an input**. Always substitute it with items like `\\\"coal\\\": 0.125` or `\\\"cherry_planks\\\": 0.667`.\\n- Similarly, if a recipe uses `#minecraft:planks`, and you hold `cherry_planks`, you may use it directly as input.\\n\\n2Ôºâ Craft Feasibility Check:\\n- Before you use `Action: craft_recipe_check`, you must **verify that your current hand has all required ingredients in sufficient quantities**.\\n- Recipes that are correct in logic but **unfeasible with your current inventory** will be rejected.\\n- To avoid this, always extract your current hand from the latest game log and/or use `possible_recipes_from_hand` to ensure your plan is executable at this moment.\\n\\n3Ôºâ Strict Recipe Matching:\\n- You must use **the exact input/output ratio** as defined in the recipe. For example, if crafting sticks requires:\\n  - `\\\"input\\\": \\\"#planks\\\": 2, \\\"output\\\": \\\"stick\\\": 4\\\"`, then don't use 1 plank and expecting 2 sticks.\\n- **Do not downscale or fraction the recipe arbitrarily.** Always follow integral crafting rules as listed in item info and recipe outputs.\\n\\n\\n# Game log:\\nHere is major events happened in the game:\\n# Goal\\n    Attention!

  "msg": "{\"text\":\"# Game Setting.\\nYou and your teamates are playing a game called **tradeCraft**, here is the game introduction.  \\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# üèÜ **Winning Condition**\\n1.Focus on crafting your target item as efficiently as possible.\\n2.Support your opponent‚Äôs progress through information-sharing and fair trade.\\n\\n# üå± **Strategy Tips**\\n1. Prioritize trades that create mutual benefit, even at short-term cost to yourself. In this mode, winning requires that both sides progress.\\n2. Openly share insights about item chains, crafting routes, and inferred goals. If you notice the other side may be stuck, offer clues or relevant resources to assist them.\\n3. Transparency and goodwill are essential ‚Äî unlike in competitive play, where bluffing, misdirection, and information hoarding are common tactics, this mode thrives on honest cooperation and trust-building.\\n4. In many other games, teams may deceive, bait, or manipulate their opponents to gain an edge. But here, such tactics undermine collective success. Replace bluffing with clarity, replace probing for secrets with volunteering support.\\n5. Think of your team and the other as allies bound by shared fate: coordination, empathy, and shared planning are your strongest weapons.\\nü§ù ‚ÄúTo win alone is to lose together. To win together is the only victory that matters.‚Äù\\n\\nYour team's username is **gemini_cooperative**.\\nYour are the **crafter** in your team: who should think what your team need, check possible recipes and carry out craft. \\nYou should stick to your **wining condition** and **strategy tips**\\n\\nNow its your turn to act, you must manage to craft some target items. Your team's username name is **gemini_cooperative**.\\nIn this game, crafting follows strictly rule set of *MineCraft*, all ingredients are required, but all related infrastructures are given.\\n\\n# Instructions\\nYou may act following the next steps: \\nstep 1. identify what items should be crafted for your final **winning condition** in your current turn according to history and current state.  \\nstep 2. from the **current state** section, extract YOUR latest hand items.  \\nstep 3. make a detailed plan about what to craft step by step, including in each step what recipes must be used and specify input / output items with their amount. Make sure you follow the guidance of **Special Tips**. You may use tools to help you know what could be crafted and the crafting properties of each item.  \\nstep 4. follow your plan step by step, using correct recipes and assign exact amount of the input / output items. While crafting each item, use tool \\\"craft_recipe_check\\\" to check for recipe correctedness, you may repeatedly checking until it is correct, then use tool \\\"craft_recipe_apply\\\" to apply it.  \\nstep 5. if target is done or mistakes happens, try to run step 3 and step 4, if a repeat does not work, return with \\\"craft_done\\\" and an error message, try to find another strategy to win the game.\\n\\nUse *Final Output:* to tell that you are done with all crafts in this turn.\\n\\n\\n# Strategic Reminder  \\nAt **every step**, especially when writing a *Thought* or deciding what to craft, **always recall your team's winning condition and strategy tips**.  \\nYour crafting plan should **serve the exact goals defined in your current game mode**: whether it is cooperation, competition, or pure self-optimization.  \\nLet your **reasoning, material prioritization, and crafting sequence** all align with your winning logic.\\n\\n## Special tips\\n1Ôºâ Tag Resolution:\\n- **Tags like `minecraft:fuel` or `minecraft:planks` are *not actual items*** ‚Äî they are *categories* used in recipes.\\n- You must **replace any tag** with a valid item from your own hand that belongs to that tag.  \\n    - For example:  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1` = `coal * 1.0` = `cherry_planks * 16/3`  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1/8` = `coal * 0.125` = `cherry_planks * 2/3`\\n- **Never submit a recipe with `\\\"minecraft:fuel\\\"` as an input**.

For example, if crafting sticks requires:\\n  - `\\\"input\\\": \\\"#planks\\\": 2, \\\"output\\\": \\\"stick\\\": 4\\\"`, then don't use 1 plank and expecting 2 sticks.\\n- **Do not downscale or fraction the recipe arbitrarily.** Always follow integral crafting rules as listed in item info and recipe outputs.\\n\\n\\n# Game log:\\nHere is major events happened in the game:\\n# Goal\\n    Attention!

  "msg": "{\"text\":\"# Game Setting.\\nYou and your teamates are playing a game called **tradeCraft**, here is the game introduction.  \\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# üèÜ **Winning Condition**\\n1.Focus on crafting your target item as efficiently as possible.\\n2.Support your opponent‚Äôs progress through information-sharing and fair trade.\\n\\n# üå± **Strategy Tips**\\n1. Prioritize trades that create mutual benefit, even at short-term cost to yourself. In this mode, winning requires that both sides progress.\\n2. Openly share insights about item chains, crafting routes, and inferred goals. If you notice the other side may be stuck, offer clues or relevant resources to assist them.\\n3. Transparency and goodwill are essential ‚Äî unlike in competitive play, where bluffing, misdirection, and information hoarding are common tactics, this mode thrives on honest cooperation and trust-building.\\n4. In many other games, teams may deceive, bait, or manipulate their opponents to gain an edge. But here, such tactics undermine collective success. Replace bluffing with clarity, replace probing for secrets with volunteering support.\\n5. Think of your team and the other as allies bound by shared fate: coordination, empathy, and shared planning are your strongest weapons.\\nü§ù ‚ÄúTo win alone is to lose together. To win together is the only victory that matters.‚Äù\\n\\nYour team's username is **gemini_cooperative**.\\nYour are the **crafter** in your team: who should think what your team need, check possible recipes and carry out craft. \\nYou should stick to your **wining condition** and **strategy tips**\\n\\nNow its your turn to act, you must manage to craft some target items. Your team's username name is **gemini_cooperative**.\\nIn this game, crafting follows strictly rule set of *MineCraft*, all ingredients are required, but all related infrastructures are given.\\n\\n# Instructions\\nYou may act following the next steps: \\nstep 1. identify what items should be crafted for your final **winning condition** in your current turn according to history and current state.  \\nstep 2. from the **current state** section, extract YOUR latest hand items.  \\nstep 3. make a detailed plan about what to craft step by step, including in each step what recipes must be used and specify input / output items with their amount. Make sure you follow the guidance of **Special Tips**. You may use tools to help you know what could be crafted and the crafting properties of each item.  \\nstep 4. follow your plan step by step, using correct recipes and assign exact amount of the input / output items. While crafting each item, use tool \\\"craft_recipe_check\\\" to check for recipe correctedness, you may repeatedly checking until it is correct, then use tool \\\"craft_recipe_apply\\\" to apply it.  \\nstep 5. if target is done or mistakes happens, try to run step 3 and step 4, if a repeat does not work, return with \\\"craft_done\\\" and an error message, try to find another strategy to win the game.\\n\\nUse *Final Output:* to tell that you are done with all crafts in this turn.\\n\\n\\n# Strategic Reminder  \\nAt **every step**, especially when writing a *Thought* or deciding what to craft, **always recall your team's winning condition and strategy tips**.  \\nYour crafting plan should **serve the exact goals defined in your current game mode**: whether it is cooperation, competition, or pure self-optimization.  \\nLet your **reasoning, material prioritization, and crafting sequence** all align with your winning logic.\\n\\n## Special tips\\n1Ôºâ Tag Resolution:\\n- **Tags like `minecraft:fuel` or `minecraft:planks` are *not actual items*** ‚Äî they are *categories* used in recipes.\\n- You must **replace any tag** with a valid item from your own hand that belongs to that tag.  \\n    - For example:  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1` = `coal * 1.0` = `cherry_planks * 16/3`  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1/8` = `coal * 0.125` = `cherry_planks * 2/3`\\n- **Never submit a recipe with `\\\"minecraft:fuel\\\"` as an input**. Always substitute it with items like `\\\"coal\\\": 0.125` or `\\\"cherry_planks\\\": 0.667`.\\n- Similarly, if a recipe uses `#minecraft:planks`, and you hold `cherry_planks`, you may use it directly as input.\\n\\n2Ôºâ Craft Feasibility Check:\\n- Before you use `Action: craft_recipe_check`, you must **verify that your current hand has all required ingredients in sufficient quantities**.\\n- Recipes that are correct in logic but **unfeasible with your current inventory** will be rejected.\\n- To avoid this, always extract your current hand from the latest game log and/or use `possible_recipes_from_hand` to ensure your plan is executable at this moment.\\n\\n3Ôºâ Strict Recipe Matching:\\n- You must use **the exact input/output ratio** as defined in the recipe. For example, if crafting sticks requires:\\n  - `\\\"input\\\": \\\"#planks\\\": 2, \\\"output\\\": \\\"stick\\\": 4\\\"`, then don't use 1 plank and expecting 2 sticks.\\n- **Do not downscale or fraction the recipe arbitrarily.** Always follow integral crafting rules as listed in item info and recipe outputs.\\n\\n\\n# Game log:\\nHere is major events happened in the game:\\n# Goal\\n    Attention!

  "msg": "{\"text\":\"# Game Setting.\\nYou and your teamates are playing a game called **tradeCraft**, here is the game introduction.  \\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# üèÜ **Winning Condition**\\n1.Focus on crafting your target item as efficiently as possible.\\n2.Support your opponent‚Äôs progress through information-sharing and fair trade.\\n\\n# üå± **Strategy Tips**\\n1. Prioritize trades that create mutual benefit, even at short-term cost to yourself. In this mode, winning requires that both sides progress.\\n2. Openly share insights about item chains, crafting routes, and inferred goals. If you notice the other side may be stuck, offer clues or relevant resources to assist them.\\n3. Transparency and goodwill are essential ‚Äî unlike in competitive play, where bluffing, misdirection, and information hoarding are common tactics, this mode thrives on honest cooperation and trust-building.\\n4. In many other games, teams may deceive, bait, or manipulate their opponents to gain an edge. But here, such tactics undermine collective success. Replace bluffing with clarity, replace probing for secrets with volunteering support.\\n5. Think of your team and the other as allies bound by shared fate: coordination, empathy, and shared planning are your strongest weapons.\\nü§ù ‚ÄúTo win alone is to lose together.

  "msg": "{\"text\":\"# Game Setting.\\nYou and your teamates are playing a game called **tradeCraft**, here is the game introduction.  \\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# üèÜ **Winning Condition**\\n1.Focus on crafting your target item as efficiently as possible.\\n2.Support your opponent‚Äôs progress through information-sharing and fair trade.\\n\\n# üå± **Strategy Tips**\\n1. Prioritize trades that create mutual benefit, even at short-term cost to yourself. In this mode, winning requires that both sides progress.\\n2. Openly share insights about item chains, crafting routes, and inferred goals. If you notice the other side may be stuck, offer clues or relevant resources to assist them.\\n3. Transparency and goodwill are essential ‚Äî unlike in competitive play, where bluffing, misdirection, and information hoarding are common tactics, this mode thrives on honest cooperation and trust-building.\\n4. In many other games, teams may deceive, bait, or manipulate their opponents to gain an edge. But here, such tactics undermine collective success. Replace bluffing with clarity, replace probing for secrets with volunteering support.\\n5. Think of your team and the other as allies bound by shared fate: coordination, empathy, and shared planning are your strongest weapons.\\nü§ù ‚ÄúTo win alone is to lose together.

  "msg": "{\"text\":\"You together with your team is playing a game called **tradeCraft**. Your team's username is **gemini_cooperative**.\\n\\n# Game introduction\\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# üèÜ **Winning Condition**\\n1.Focus on crafting your target item as efficiently as possible.\\n2.Support your opponent‚Äôs progress through information-sharing and fair trade.\\n\\n# üå± **Strategy Tips**\\n1.

  "msg": "{\"text\":\"You together with your team is playing a game called **tradeCraft**. Your team's username is **gemini_cooperative**.\\n\\n# Game introduction\\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# üèÜ **Winning Condition**\\n1.Focus on crafting your target item as efficiently as possible.\\n2.Support your opponent‚Äôs progress through information-sharing and fair trade.\\n\\n# üå± **Strategy Tips**\\n1. Prioritize trades that create mutual benefit, even at short-term cost to yourself. In this mode, winning requires that both sides progress.\\n2. Openly share insights about item chains, crafting routes, and inferred goals. If you notice the other side may be stuck, offer clues or relevant resources to assist them.\\n3. Transparency and goodwill are essential ‚Äî unlike in competitive play, where bluffing, misdirection, and information hoarding are common tactics, this mode thrives on honest cooperation and trust-building.\\n4. In many other games, teams may deceive, bait, or manipulate their opponents to gain an edge. But here, such tactics undermine collective success. Replace bluffing with clarity, replace probing for secrets with volunteering support.\\n5. Think of your team and the other as allies bound by shared fate: coordination, empathy, and shared planning are your strongest weapons.\\nü§ù ‚ÄúTo win alone is to lose together. To win together is the only victory that matters.‚Äù\\n\\n# Your task:\\n(1) You must **make a plan** for this round, where your immediate goal is to handle the task of **crafting**.\\n(2) You may predict what will happen and think about the best strategy to win. \\n(3) You have your old plan for reference. REMEMBER, **you are planning**, so you may ask for information, but not able to make a proposal / make a decision or do a crafting. \\n(4) And in the output plan, you should use symbol **<current status>** to annotate the border between true game history and the plan / prediction. \\n\\n# Useable tools:\\npossible_recipes_from_hand - Get the list of possible craft recipes affordable by your hand resources.\\n\\n        Args:\\n            messages:dict = {\\\"username\\\": your username}\\nitem_info - Get crafting recipes related to `item_name`.\\n        The return is in format of a string.\\n        First line of return is the recipes which can output the item ({input: ingredients, output: results}),\\n        each item is given as `item_name:item_value` pair, where item_value is a fraction of form {n: number, d: number}\\n        where n s numerator and d represents denominator.\\n        Second line of the return is the recipes where item can be used as input.\\n\\n        Args:\\n            messages:str = \\\"item_name\\\"\\nrethink(messages: str) - Dummy Tool\\n\\nA tool which can buy you another round to rethink.\\nIt accepts any string for inupt and outputs empty string.\\n\\nArgs:\\nmessages = \\\"any string\\\"\\n\\n# Instructions\\n[Important Note 1] In this game, **the amount of the items are important**, you must take care of the exact amount of each item you need in the plan. You may plan by answering the following questions:\\n1. What is my target. What does each player have in hand?\\n2. What are possible ways to craft the target, based on items in all player's hands, how many do I need? Is it still possible for me to craft?\\n3. What must I trade from other players, trade with which item and how many.\\n4. What might other players' targets be? What might others think?\\n5. How to avoid other players' obtaining the target before me?\\n6. How would I use the items? Write the crafting plan step by step.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n# Output Format\\n**Your output should strictly follow the format below**, **you MUST use the tags to control the flow**:\\n - Thought: you should always think about what to do\\n - Action: the action you can take, should be one of [possible_recipes_from_hand, item_info, rethink].\\n - Action Input: the input to the action, according to the tool's arguments. \\n - Thought: I think I have a good plan.\\n - Final Output: the most reasonable plan you make for this game and the whole plan you make\\n\\n# Recent Observations & History(Turns Recordings):\\n### Proposing Phase\\nNow it's your turn for proposing.\\n\\n\\n\\nAttention!

  "msg": "{\"text\":\"You together with your team is playing a game called **tradeCraft**. Your team's username is **gemini_cooperative**.\\n\\n# Game introduction\\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# üèÜ **Winning Condition**\\n1.Focus on crafting your target item as efficiently as possible.\\n2.Support your opponent‚Äôs progress through information-sharing and fair trade.\\n\\n# üå± **Strategy Tips**\\n1. Prioritize trades that create mutual benefit, even at short-term cost to yourself. In this mode, winning requires that both sides progress.\\n2. Openly share insights about item chains, crafting routes, and inferred goals. If you notice the other side may be stuck, offer clues or relevant resources to assist them.\\n3. Transparency and goodwill are essential ‚Äî unlike in competitive play, where bluffing, misdirection, and information hoarding are common tactics, this mode thrives on honest cooperation and trust-building.\\n4. In many other games, teams may deceive, bait, or manipulate their opponents to gain an edge. But here, such tactics undermine collective success. Replace bluffing with clarity, replace probing for secrets with volunteering support.\\n5. Think of your team and the other as allies bound by shared fate: coordination, empathy, and shared planning are your strongest weapons.\\nü§ù ‚ÄúTo win alone is to lose together. To win together is the only victory that matters.‚Äù\\n\\n# Your task:\\n(1) You must **make a plan** for this round, where your immediate goal is to handle the task of **crafting**.\\n(2) You may predict what will happen and think about the best strategy to win. \\n(3) You have your old plan for reference. REMEMBER, **you are planning**, so you may ask for information, but not able to make a proposal / make a decision or do a crafting. \\n(4) And in the output plan, you should use symbol **<current status>** to annotate the border between true game history and the plan / prediction. \\n\\n# Useable tools:\\npossible_recipes_from_hand - Get the list of possible craft recipes affordable by your hand resources.\\n\\n        Args:\\n            messages:dict = {\\\"username\\\": your username}\\nitem_info - Get crafting recipes related to `item_name`.\\n        The return is in format of a string.\\n        First line of return is the recipes which can output the item ({input: ingredients, output: results}),\\n        each item is given as `item_name:item_value` pair, where item_value is a fraction of form {n: number, d: number}\\n        where n s numerator and d represents denominator.\\n        Second line of the return is the recipes where item can be used as input.\\n\\n        Args:\\n            messages:str = \\\"item_name\\\"\\nrethink(messages: str) - Dummy Tool\\n\\nA tool which can buy you another round to rethink.\\nIt accepts any string for inupt and outputs empty string.\\n\\nArgs:\\nmessages = \\\"any string\\\"\\n\\n# Instructions\\n[Important Note 1] In this game, **the amount of the items are important**, you must take care of the exact amount of each item you need in the plan. You may plan by answering the following questions:\\n1. What is my target. What does each player have in hand?\\n2. What are possible ways to craft the target, based on items in all player's hands, how many do I need? Is it still possible for me to craft?\\n3. What must I trade from other players, trade with which item and how many.\\n4. What might other players' targets be? What might others think?\\n5. How to avoid other players' obtaining the target before me?\\n6. How would I use the items? Write the crafting plan step by step.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n# Output Format\\n**Your output should strictly follow the format below**, **you MUST use the tags to control the flow**:\\n - Thought: you should always think about what to do\\n - Action: the action you can take, should be one of [possible_recipes_from_hand, item_info, rethink].\\n - Action Input: the input to the action, according to the tool's arguments. \\n - Thought: I think I have a good plan.\\n - Final Output: the most reasonable plan you make for this game and the whole plan you make\\n\\n# Recent Observations & History(Turns Recordings):\\n### Proposing Phase\\nNow it's your turn for proposing.\\n\\n\\n\\nAttention!

You should:\\n- Focus on the most recent player actions and state updates.\\n- Ignore repeated or irrelevant exchanges.\\n- Pay attention to any item changes, successful trades, and crafting results.\\n- Note that the entire observation is time-ordered: it starts from the beginning of the game and ends at the current turn.\\n## Special tips\\n1Ôºâ Tag Resolution:\\n- **Tags like `minecraft:fuel` or `minecraft:planks` are *not actual items*** ‚Äî they are *categories* used in recipes.\\n- You must **replace any tag** with a valid item from your own hand that belongs to that tag.  \\n    - For example:  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1` = `coal * 1.0` = `cherry_planks * 16/3`  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1/8` = `coal * 0.125` = `cherry_planks * 2/3`\\n- **Never submit a recipe with `\\\"minecraft:fuel\\\"` as an input**. Always substitute it with items like `\\\"coal\\\": 0.125` or `\\\"cherry_planks\\\": 0.667`.\\n- Similarly, if a recipe uses `#minecraft:planks`, and you hold `cherry_planks`, you may use it directly as input.\\n2Ôºâ Strict Recipe Matching:\\n- You must use **the exact input/output ratio** as defined in the recipe. For example, if crafting sticks requires:\\n  - `\\\"input\\\": \\\"#planks\\\": 2, \\\"output\\\": \\\"stick\\\": 4\\\"`, then don't use 1 plank and expecting 2 sticks.\\n- **Do not downscale or fraction the recipe arbitrarily.** Always follow integral crafting rules as listed in item info and recipe outputs.\\n\\n\\n# Old Plan:\\nHere is the plan you made last time, for your reference: \\nAgent stopped due to iteration limit or time limit.\\n\\nWhen you make a plan, focus on the items you already have, as well as **the items you are targeting**,to make a plan.Now, start making your plan for this turn!\\nParsing LLM output produced both a final answer and a parse-able action:: Thought: My target is `minecraft:iron_pickaxe`.

  "msg": "{\"text\":\"You together with your team is playing a game called **tradeCraft**. Your team's username is **gemini_cooperative**.\\n\\n# Game introduction\\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# üèÜ **Winning Condition**\\n1.Focus on crafting your target item as efficiently as possible.\\n2.Support your opponent‚Äôs progress through information-sharing and fair trade.\\n\\n# üå± **Strategy Tips**\\n1. Prioritize trades that create mutual benefit, even at short-term cost to yourself. In this mode, winning requires that both sides progress.\\n2. Openly share insights about item chains, crafting routes, and inferred goals. If you notice the other side may be stuck, offer clues or relevant resources to assist them.\\n3. Transparency and goodwill are essential ‚Äî unlike in competitive play, where bluffing, misdirection, and information hoarding are common tactics, this mode thrives on honest cooperation and trust-building.\\n4. In many other games, teams may deceive, bait, or manipulate their opponents to gain an edge. But here, such tactics undermine collective success. Replace bluffing with clarity, replace probing for secrets with volunteering support.\\n5. Think of your team and the other as allies bound by shared fate: coordination, empathy, and shared planning are your strongest weapons.\\nü§ù ‚ÄúTo win alone is to lose together. To win together is the only victory that matters.‚Äù\\n\\n# Your task:\\n(1) You must **make a plan** for this round, where your immediate goal is to handle the task of **crafting**.\\n(2) You may predict what will happen and think about the best strategy to win. \\n(3) You have your old plan for reference. REMEMBER, **you are planning**, so you may ask for information, but not able to make a proposal / make a decision or do a crafting. \\n(4) And in the output plan, you should use symbol **<current status>** to annotate the border between true game history and the plan / prediction. \\n\\n# Useable tools:\\npossible_recipes_from_hand - Get the list of possible craft recipes affordable by your hand resources.\\n\\n        Args:\\n            messages:dict = {\\\"username\\\": your username}\\nitem_info - Get crafting recipes related to `item_name`.\\n        The return is in format of a string.\\n        First line of return is the recipes which can output the item ({input: ingredients, output: results}),\\n        each item is given as `item_name:item_value` pair, where item_value is a fraction of form {n: number, d: number}\\n        where n s numerator and d represents denominator.\\n        Second line of the return is the recipes where item can be used as input.\\n\\n        Args:\\n            messages:str = \\\"item_name\\\"\\nrethink(messages: str) - Dummy Tool\\n\\nA tool which can buy you another round to rethink.\\nIt accepts any string for inupt and outputs empty string.\\n\\nArgs:\\nmessages = \\\"any string\\\"\\n\\n# Instructions\\n[Important Note 1] In this game, **the amount of the items are important**, you must take care of the exact amount of each item you need in the plan. You may plan by answering the following questions:\\n1. What is my target. What does each player have in hand?\\n2. What are possible ways to craft the target, based on items in all player's hands, how many do I need? Is it still possible for me to craft?\\n3. What must I trade from other players, trade with which item and how many.\\n4. What might other players' targets be? What might others think?\\n5. How to avoid other players' obtaining the target before me?\\n6. How would I use the items? Write the crafting plan step by step.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n# Output Format\\n**Your output should strictly follow the format below**, **you MUST use the tags to control the flow**:\\n - Thought: you should always think about what to do\\n - Action: the action you can take, should be one of [possible_recipes_from_hand, item_info, rethink].\\n - Action Input: the input to the action, according to the tool's arguments. \\n - Thought: I think I have a good plan.\\n - Final Output: the most reasonable plan you make for this game and the whole plan you make\\n\\n# Recent Observations & History(Turns Recordings):\\n### Proposing Phase\\nNow it's your turn for proposing.\\n\\n\\n\\nAttention!

You should:\\n- Focus on the most recent player actions and state updates.\\n- Ignore repeated or irrelevant exchanges.\\n- Pay attention to any item changes, successful trades, and crafting results.\\n- Note that the entire observation is time-ordered: it starts from the beginning of the game and ends at the current turn.\\n## Special tips\\n1Ôºâ Tag Resolution:\\n- **Tags like `minecraft:fuel` or `minecraft:planks` are *not actual items*** ‚Äî they are *categories* used in recipes.\\n- You must **replace any tag** with a valid item from your own hand that belongs to that tag.  \\n    - For example:  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1` = `coal * 1.0` = `cherry_planks * 16/3`  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1/8` = `coal * 0.125` = `cherry_planks * 2/3`\\n- **Never submit a recipe with `\\\"minecraft:fuel\\\"` as an input**. Always substitute it with items like `\\\"coal\\\": 0.125` or `\\\"cherry_planks\\\": 0.667`.\\n- Similarly, if a recipe uses `#minecraft:planks`, and you hold `cherry_planks`, you may use it directly as input.\\n2Ôºâ Strict Recipe Matching:\\n- You must use **the exact input/output ratio** as defined in the recipe. For example, if crafting sticks requires:\\n  - `\\\"input\\\": \\\"#planks\\\": 2, \\\"output\\\": \\\"stick\\\": 4\\\"`, then don't use 1 plank and expecting 2 sticks.\\n- **Do not downscale or fraction the recipe arbitrarily.** Always follow integral crafting rules as listed in item info and recipe outputs.\\n\\n\\n# Old Plan:\\nHere is the plan you made last time, for your reference: \\nAgent stopped due to iteration limit or time limit.\\n\\nWhen you make a plan, focus on the items you already have, as well as **the items you are targeting**,to make a plan.Now, start making your plan for this turn!\\nParsing LLM output produced both a final answer and a parse-able action:: Thought: My target is `minecraft:iron_pickaxe`.

  "msg": "{\"text\":\"# Game Setting.\\nYou and your teamates are playing a game called **tradeCraft**, here is the game introduction.  \\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# üèÜ **Winning Condition**\\n1.Focus on crafting your target item as efficiently as possible.\\n2.Support your opponent‚Äôs progress through information-sharing and fair trade.\\n\\n# üå± **Strategy Tips**\\n1. Prioritize trades that create mutual benefit, even at short-term cost to yourself. In this mode, winning requires that both sides progress.\\n2. Openly share insights about item chains, crafting routes, and inferred goals. If you notice the other side may be stuck, offer clues or relevant resources to assist them.\\n3. Transparency and goodwill are essential ‚Äî unlike in competitive play, where bluffing, misdirection, and information hoarding are common tactics, this mode thrives on honest cooperation and trust-building.\\n4. In many other games, teams may deceive, bait, or manipulate their opponents to gain an edge. But here, such tactics undermine collective success. Replace bluffing with clarity, replace probing for secrets with volunteering support.\\n5. Think of your team and the other as allies bound by shared fate: coordination, empathy, and shared planning are your strongest weapons.\\nü§ù ‚ÄúTo win alone is to lose together. To win together is the only victory that matters.‚Äù\\n\\nYour team's username is **gemini_cooperative**.\\nYour are the **crafter** in your team: who should think what your team need, check possible recipes and carry out craft. \\nYou should stick to your **wining condition** and **strategy tips**\\n\\nNow its your turn to act, you must manage to craft some target items. Your team's username name is **gemini_cooperative**.\\nIn this game, crafting follows strictly rule set of *MineCraft*, all ingredients are required, but all related infrastructures are given.\\n\\n# Instructions\\nYou may act following the next steps: \\nstep 1. identify what items should be crafted for your final **winning condition** in your current turn according to history and current state.  \\nstep 2. from the **current state** section, extract YOUR latest hand items.  \\nstep 3. make a detailed plan about what to craft step by step, including in each step what recipes must be used and specify input / output items with their amount. Make sure you follow the guidance of **Special Tips**. You may use tools to help you know what could be crafted and the crafting properties of each item.  \\nstep 4. follow your plan step by step, using correct recipes and assign exact amount of the input / output items. While crafting each item, use tool \\\"craft_recipe_check\\\" to check for recipe correctedness, you may repeatedly checking until it is correct, then use tool \\\"craft_recipe_apply\\\" to apply it.  \\nstep 5. if target is done or mistakes happens, try to run step 3 and step 4, if a repeat does not work, return with \\\"craft_done\\\" and an error message, try to find another strategy to win the game.\\n\\nUse *Final Output:* to tell that you are done with all crafts in this turn.\\n\\n\\n# Strategic Reminder  \\nAt **every step**, especially when writing a *Thought* or deciding what to craft, **always recall your team's winning condition and strategy tips**.  \\nYour crafting plan should **serve the exact goals defined in your current game mode**: whether it is cooperation, competition, or pure self-optimization.  \\nLet your **reasoning, material prioritization, and crafting sequence** all align with your winning logic.\\n\\n## Special tips\\n1Ôºâ Tag Resolution:\\n- **Tags like `minecraft:fuel` or `minecraft:planks` are *not actual items*** ‚Äî they are *categories* used in recipes.\\n- You must **replace any tag** with a valid item from your own hand that belongs to that tag.  \\n    - For example:  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1` = `coal * 1.0` = `cherry_planks * 16/3`  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1/8` = `coal * 0.125` = `cherry_planks * 2/3`\\n- **Never submit a recipe with `\\\"minecraft:fuel\\\"` as an input**. Always substitute it with items like `\\\"coal\\\": 0.125` or `\\\"cherry_planks\\\": 0.667`.\\n- Similarly, if a recipe uses `#minecraft:planks`, and you hold `cherry_planks`, you may use it directly as input.\\n\\n2Ôºâ Craft Feasibility Check:\\n- Before you use `Action: craft_recipe_check`, you must **verify that your current hand has all required ingredients in sufficient quantities**.\\n- Recipes that are correct in logic but **unfeasible with your current inventory** will be rejected.\\n- To avoid this, always extract your current hand from the latest game log and/or use `possible_recipes_from_hand` to ensure your plan is executable at this moment.\\n\\n3Ôºâ Strict Recipe Matching:\\n- You must use **the exact input/output ratio** as defined in the recipe. For example, if crafting sticks requires:\\n  - `\\\"input\\\": \\\"#planks\\\": 2, \\\"output\\\": \\\"stick\\\": 4\\\"`, then don't use 1 plank and expecting 2 sticks.\\n- **Do not downscale or fraction the recipe arbitrarily.** Always follow integral crafting rules as listed in item info and recipe outputs.\\n\\n\\n# Game log:\\nHere is major events happened in the game:\\n### Proposing Phase\\nNow it's your turn for proposing.\\n\\n\\n\\nAttention!

A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server.

  "msg": "{\"text\":\"# Game Setting.\\nYou and your teamates are playing a game called **tradeCraft**, here is the game introduction.  \\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# üèÜ **Winning Condition**\\n1.Focus on crafting your target item as efficiently as possible.\\n2.Support your opponent‚Äôs progress through information-sharing and fair trade.\\n\\n# üå± **Strategy Tips**\\n1.

Transparency and goodwill are essential ‚Äî unlike in competitive play, where bluffing, misdirection, and information hoarding are common tactics, this mode thrives on honest cooperation and trust-building.\\n4. In many other games, teams may deceive, bait, or manipulate their opponents to gain an edge. But here, such tactics undermine collective success.

  "msg": "{\"text\":\"# Game Setting.\\nYou and your teamates are playing a game called **tradeCraft**, here is the game introduction.  \\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# üèÜ **Winning Condition**\\n1.Focus on crafting your target item as efficiently as possible.\\n2.Support your opponent‚Äôs progress through information-sharing and fair trade.\\n\\n# üå± **Strategy Tips**\\n1. Prioritize trades that create mutual benefit, even at short-term cost to yourself. In this mode, winning requires that both sides progress.\\n2. Openly share insights about item chains, crafting routes, and inferred goals. If you notice the other side may be stuck, offer clues or relevant resources to assist them.\\n3. Transparency and goodwill are essential ‚Äî unlike in competitive play, where bluffing, misdirection, and information hoarding are common tactics, this mode thrives on honest cooperation and trust-building.\\n4. In many other games, teams may deceive, bait, or manipulate their opponents to gain an edge. But here, such tactics undermine collective success. Replace bluffing with clarity, replace probing for secrets with volunteering support.\\n5. Think of your team and the other as allies bound by shared fate: coordination, empathy, and shared planning are your strongest weapons.\\nü§ù ‚ÄúTo win alone is to lose together. To win together is the only victory that matters.‚Äù\\n\\nYour team's username is **gemini_cooperative**.\\nYour are the **crafter** in your team: who should think what your team need, check possible recipes and carry out craft. \\nYou should stick to your **wining condition** and **strategy tips**\\n\\nNow its your turn to act, you must manage to craft some target items. Your team's username name is **gemini_cooperative**.\\nIn this game, crafting follows strictly rule set of *MineCraft*, all ingredients are required, but all related infrastructures are given.\\n\\n# Instructions\\nYou may act following the next steps: \\nstep 1. identify what items should be crafted for your final **winning condition** in your current turn according to history and current state.  \\nstep 2. from the **current state** section, extract YOUR latest hand items.  \\nstep 3. make a detailed plan about what to craft step by step, including in each step what recipes must be used and specify input / output items with their amount. Make sure you follow the guidance of **Special Tips**. You may use tools to help you know what could be crafted and the crafting properties of each item.  \\nstep 4. follow your plan step by step, using correct recipes and assign exact amount of the input / output items. While crafting each item, use tool \\\"craft_recipe_check\\\" to check for recipe correctedness, you may repeatedly checking until it is correct, then use tool \\\"craft_recipe_apply\\\" to apply it.  \\nstep 5. if target is done or mistakes happens, try to run step 3 and step 4, if a repeat does not work, return with \\\"craft_done\\\" and an error message, try to find another strategy to win the game.\\n\\nUse *Final Output:* to tell that you are done with all crafts in this turn.\\n\\n\\n# Strategic Reminder  \\nAt **every step**, especially when writing a *Thought* or deciding what to craft, **always recall your team's winning condition and strategy tips**.  \\nYour crafting plan should **serve the exact goals defined in your current game mode**: whether it is cooperation, competition, or pure self-optimization.  \\nLet your **reasoning, material prioritization, and crafting sequence** all align with your winning logic.\\n\\n## Special tips\\n1Ôºâ Tag Resolution:\\n- **Tags like `minecraft:fuel` or `minecraft:planks` are *not actual items*** ‚Äî they are *categories* used in recipes.\\n- You must **replace any tag** with a valid item from your own hand that belongs to that tag.  \\n    - For example:  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1` = `coal * 1.0` = `cherry_planks * 16/3`  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1/8` = `coal * 0.125` = `cherry_planks * 2/3`\\n- **Never submit a recipe with `\\\"minecraft:fuel\\\"` as an input**. Always substitute it with items like `\\\"coal\\\": 0.125` or `\\\"cherry_planks\\\": 0.667`.\\n- Similarly, if a recipe uses `#minecraft:planks`, and you hold `cherry_planks`, you may use it directly as input.\\n\\n2Ôºâ Craft Feasibility Check:\\n- Before you use `Action: craft_recipe_check`, you must **verify that your current hand has all required ingredients in sufficient quantities**.\\n- Recipes that are correct in logic but **unfeasible with your current inventory** will be rejected.\\n- To avoid this, always extract your current hand from the latest game log and/or use `possible_recipes_from_hand` to ensure your plan is executable at this moment.\\n\\n3Ôºâ Strict Recipe Matching:\\n- You must use **the exact input/output ratio** as defined in the recipe. For example, if crafting sticks requires:\\n  - `\\\"input\\\": \\\"#planks\\\": 2, \\\"output\\\": \\\"stick\\\": 4\\\"`, then don't use 1 plank and expecting 2 sticks.\\n- **Do not downscale or fraction the recipe arbitrarily.** Always follow integral crafting rules as listed in item info and recipe outputs.\\n\\n\\n# Game log:\\nHere is major events happened in the game:\\n### Proposing Phase\\nNow it's your turn for proposing.\\n\\n\\n\\nAttention!

  "msg": "{\"text\":\"# Game Setting.\\nYou and your teamates are playing a game called **tradeCraft**, here is the game introduction.  \\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# üèÜ **Winning Condition**\\n1.Focus on crafting your target item as efficiently as possible.\\n2.Support your opponent‚Äôs progress through information-sharing and fair trade.\\n\\n# üå± **Strategy Tips**\\n1. Prioritize trades that create mutual benefit, even at short-term cost to yourself. In this mode, winning requires that both sides progress.\\n2. Openly share insights about item chains, crafting routes, and inferred goals. If you notice the other side may be stuck, offer clues or relevant resources to assist them.\\n3. Transparency and goodwill are essential ‚Äî unlike in competitive play, where bluffing, misdirection, and information hoarding are common tactics, this mode thrives on honest cooperation and trust-building.\\n4. In many other games, teams may deceive, bait, or manipulate their opponents to gain an edge. But here, such tactics undermine collective success. Replace bluffing with clarity, replace probing for secrets with volunteering support.\\n5. Think of your team and the other as allies bound by shared fate: coordination, empathy, and shared planning are your strongest weapons.\\nü§ù ‚ÄúTo win alone is to lose together. To win together is the only victory that matters.‚Äù\\n\\nYour team's username is **gemini_cooperative**.\\nYour are the **crafter** in your team: who should think what your team need, check possible recipes and carry out craft. \\nYou should stick to your **wining condition** and **strategy tips**\\n\\nNow its your turn to act, you must manage to craft some target items. Your team's username name is **gemini_cooperative**.\\nIn this game, crafting follows strictly rule set of *MineCraft*, all ingredients are required, but all related infrastructures are given.\\n\\n# Instructions\\nYou may act following the next steps: \\nstep 1. identify what items should be crafted for your final **winning condition** in your current turn according to history and current state.  \\nstep 2. from the **current state** section, extract YOUR latest hand items.  \\nstep 3. make a detailed plan about what to craft step by step, including in each step what recipes must be used and specify input / output items with their amount. Make sure you follow the guidance of **Special Tips**. You may use tools to help you know what could be crafted and the crafting properties of each item.  \\nstep 4. follow your plan step by step, using correct recipes and assign exact amount of the input / output items. While crafting each item, use tool \\\"craft_recipe_check\\\" to check for recipe correctedness, you may repeatedly checking until it is correct, then use tool \\\"craft_recipe_apply\\\" to apply it.  \\nstep 5. if target is done or mistakes happens, try to run step 3 and step 4, if a repeat does not work, return with \\\"craft_done\\\" and an error message, try to find another strategy to win the game.\\n\\nUse *Final Output:* to tell that you are done with all crafts in this turn.\\n\\n\\n# Strategic Reminder  \\nAt **every step**, especially when writing a *Thought* or deciding what to craft, **always recall your team's winning condition and strategy tips**.  \\nYour crafting plan should **serve the exact goals defined in your current game mode**: whether it is cooperation, competition, or pure self-optimization.  \\nLet your **reasoning, material prioritization, and crafting sequence** all align with your winning logic.\\n\\n## Special tips\\n1Ôºâ Tag Resolution:\\n- **Tags like `minecraft:fuel` or `minecraft:planks` are *not actual items*** ‚Äî they are *categories* used in recipes.\\n- You must **replace any tag** with a valid item from your own hand that belongs to that tag.  \\n    - For example:  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1` = `coal * 1.0` = `cherry_planks * 16/3`  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1/8` = `coal * 0.125` = `cherry_planks * 2/3`\\n- **Never submit a recipe with `\\\"minecraft:fuel\\\"` as an input**. Always substitute it with items like `\\\"coal\\\": 0.125` or `\\\"cherry_planks\\\": 0.667`.\\n- Similarly, if a recipe uses `#minecraft:planks`, and you hold `cherry_planks`, you may use it directly as input.\\n\\n2Ôºâ Craft Feasibility Check:\\n- Before you use `Action: craft_recipe_check`, you must **verify that your current hand has all required ingredients in sufficient quantities**.\\n- Recipes that are correct in logic but **unfeasible with your current inventory** will be rejected.\\n- To avoid this, always extract your current hand from the latest game log and/or use `possible_recipes_from_hand` to ensure your plan is executable at this moment.\\n\\n3Ôºâ Strict Recipe Matching:\\n- You must use **the exact input/output ratio** as defined in the recipe. For example, if crafting sticks requires:\\n  - `\\\"input\\\": \\\"#planks\\\": 2, \\\"output\\\": \\\"stick\\\": 4\\\"`, then don't use 1 plank and expecting 2 sticks.\\n- **Do not downscale or fraction the recipe arbitrarily.** Always follow integral crafting rules as listed in item info and recipe outputs.\\n\\n\\n# Game log:\\nHere is major events happened in the game:\\n### Proposing Phase\\nNow it's your turn for proposing.\\n\\n\\n\\nAttention!

  "msg": "{\"text\":\"# Game Setting.\\nYou and your teamates are playing a game called **tradeCraft**, here is the game introduction.  \\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# üèÜ **Winning Condition**\\n1.Focus on crafting your target item as efficiently as possible.\\n2.Support your opponent‚Äôs progress through information-sharing and fair trade.\\n\\n# üå± **Strategy Tips**\\n1. Prioritize trades that create mutual benefit, even at short-term cost to yourself. In this mode, winning requires that both sides progress.\\n2. Openly share insights about item chains, crafting routes, and inferred goals. If you notice the other side may be stuck, offer clues or relevant resources to assist them.\\n3. Transparency and goodwill are essential ‚Äî unlike in competitive play, where bluffing, misdirection, and information hoarding are common tactics, this mode thrives on honest cooperation and trust-building.\\n4. In many other games, teams may deceive, bait, or manipulate their opponents to gain an edge. But here, such tactics undermine collective success. Replace bluffing with clarity, replace probing for secrets with volunteering support.\\n5. Think of your team and the other as allies bound by shared fate: coordination, empathy, and shared planning are your strongest weapons.\\nü§ù ‚ÄúTo win alone is to lose together. To win together is the only victory that matters.‚Äù\\n\\nYour team's username is **gemini_cooperative**.\\nYour are the **crafter** in your team: who should think what your team need, check possible recipes and carry out craft. \\nYou should stick to your **wining condition** and **strategy tips**\\n\\nNow its your turn to act, you must manage to craft some target items. Your team's username name is **gemini_cooperative**.\\nIn this game, crafting follows strictly rule set of *MineCraft*, all ingredients are required, but all related infrastructures are given.\\n\\n# Instructions\\nYou may act following the next steps: \\nstep 1. identify what items should be crafted for your final **winning condition** in your current turn according to history and current state.  \\nstep 2. from the **current state** section, extract YOUR latest hand items.  \\nstep 3. make a detailed plan about what to craft step by step, including in each step what recipes must be used and specify input / output items with their amount. Make sure you follow the guidance of **Special Tips**. You may use tools to help you know what could be crafted and the crafting properties of each item.  \\nstep 4. follow your plan step by step, using correct recipes and assign exact amount of the input / output items. While crafting each item, use tool \\\"craft_recipe_check\\\" to check for recipe correctedness, you may repeatedly checking until it is correct, then use tool \\\"craft_recipe_apply\\\" to apply it.  \\nstep 5. if target is done or mistakes happens, try to run step 3 and step 4, if a repeat does not work, return with \\\"craft_done\\\" and an error message, try to find another strategy to win the game.\\n\\nUse *Final Output:* to tell that you are done with all crafts in this turn.\\n\\n\\n# Strategic Reminder  \\nAt **every step**, especially when writing a *Thought* or deciding what to craft, **always recall your team's winning condition and strategy tips**.  \\nYour crafting plan should **serve the exact goals defined in your current game mode**: whether it is cooperation, competition, or pure self-optimization.  \\nLet your **reasoning, material prioritization, and crafting sequence** all align with your winning logic.\\n\\n## Special tips\\n1Ôºâ Tag Resolution:\\n- **Tags like `minecraft:fuel` or `minecraft:planks` are *not actual items*** ‚Äî they are *categories* used in recipes.\\n- You must **replace any tag** with a valid item from your own hand that belongs to that tag.  \\n    - For example:  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1` = `coal * 1.0` = `cherry_planks * 16/3`  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1/8` = `coal * 0.125` = `cherry_planks * 2/3`\\n- **Never submit a recipe with `\\\"minecraft:fuel\\\"` as an input**. Always substitute it with items like `\\\"coal\\\": 0.125` or `\\\"cherry_planks\\\": 0.667`.\\n- Similarly, if a recipe uses `#minecraft:planks`, and you hold `cherry_planks`, you may use it directly as input.\\n\\n2Ôºâ Craft Feasibility Check:\\n- Before you use `Action: craft_recipe_check`, you must **verify that your current hand has all required ingredients in sufficient quantities**.\\n- Recipes that are correct in logic but **unfeasible with your current inventory** will be rejected.\\n- To avoid this, always extract your current hand from the latest game log and/or use `possible_recipes_from_hand` to ensure your plan is executable at this moment.\\n\\n3Ôºâ Strict Recipe Matching:\\n- You must use **the exact input/output ratio** as defined in the recipe. For example, if crafting sticks requires:\\n  - `\\\"input\\\": \\\"#planks\\\": 2, \\\"output\\\": \\\"stick\\\": 4\\\"`, then don't use 1 plank and expecting 2 sticks.\\n- **Do not downscale or fraction the recipe arbitrarily.** Always follow integral crafting rules as listed in item info and recipe outputs.\\n\\n\\n# Game log:\\nHere is major events happened in the game:\\n### Proposing Phase\\nNow it's your turn for proposing.\\n\\n\\n\\nAttention!

  "msg": "{\"text\":\"# Game Setting.\\nYou and your teamates are playing a game called **tradeCraft**, here is the game introduction.  \\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# üèÜ **Winning Condition**\\n1.Focus on crafting your target item as efficiently as possible.\\n2.Support your opponent‚Äôs progress through information-sharing and fair trade.\\n\\n# üå± **Strategy Tips**\\n1. Prioritize trades that create mutual benefit, even at short-term cost to yourself. In this mode, winning requires that both sides progress.\\n2. Openly share insights about item chains, crafting routes, and inferred goals. If you notice the other side may be stuck, offer clues or relevant resources to assist them.\\n3. Transparency and goodwill are essential ‚Äî unlike in competitive play, where bluffing, misdirection, and information hoarding are common tactics, this mode thrives on honest cooperation and trust-building.\\n4. In many other games, teams may deceive, bait, or manipulate their opponents to gain an edge. But here, such tactics undermine collective success. Replace bluffing with clarity, replace probing for secrets with volunteering support.\\n5. Think of your team and the other as allies bound by shared fate: coordination, empathy, and shared planning are your strongest weapons.\\nü§ù ‚ÄúTo win alone is to lose together. To win together is the only victory that matters.‚Äù\\n\\nYour team's username is **gemini_cooperative**.\\nYour are the **crafter** in your team: who should think what your team need, check possible recipes and carry out craft. \\nYou should stick to your **wining condition** and **strategy tips**\\n\\nNow its your turn to act, you must manage to craft some target items. Your team's username name is **gemini_cooperative**.\\nIn this game, crafting follows strictly rule set of *MineCraft*, all ingredients are required, but all related infrastructures are given.\\n\\n# Instructions\\nYou may act following the next steps: \\nstep 1. identify what items should be crafted for your final **winning condition** in your current turn according to history and current state.  \\nstep 2. from the **current state** section, extract YOUR latest hand items.  \\nstep 3. make a detailed plan about what to craft step by step, including in each step what recipes must be used and specify input / output items with their amount. Make sure you follow the guidance of **Special Tips**. You may use tools to help you know what could be crafted and the crafting properties of each item.  \\nstep 4. follow your plan step by step, using correct recipes and assign exact amount of the input / output items. While crafting each item, use tool \\\"craft_recipe_check\\\" to check for recipe correctedness, you may repeatedly checking until it is correct, then use tool \\\"craft_recipe_apply\\\" to apply it.  \\nstep 5. if target is done or mistakes happens, try to run step 3 and step 4, if a repeat does not work, return with \\\"craft_done\\\" and an error message, try to find another strategy to win the game.\\n\\nUse *Final Output:* to tell that you are done with all crafts in this turn.\\n\\n\\n# Strategic Reminder  \\nAt **every step**, especially when writing a *Thought* or deciding what to craft, **always recall your team's winning condition and strategy tips**.  \\nYour crafting plan should **serve the exact goals defined in your current game mode**: whether it is cooperation, competition, or pure self-optimization.  \\nLet your **reasoning, material prioritization, and crafting sequence** all align with your winning logic.\\n\\n## Special tips\\n1Ôºâ Tag Resolution:\\n- **Tags like `minecraft:fuel` or `minecraft:planks` are *not actual items*** ‚Äî they are *categories* used in recipes.\\n- You must **replace any tag** with a valid item from your own hand that belongs to that tag.  \\n    - For example:  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1` = `coal * 1.0` = `cherry_planks * 16/3`  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1/8` = `coal * 0.125` = `cherry_planks * 2/3`\\n- **Never submit a recipe with `\\\"minecraft:fuel\\\"` as an input**. Always substitute it with items like `\\\"coal\\\": 0.125` or `\\\"cherry_planks\\\": 0.667`.\\n- Similarly, if a recipe uses `#minecraft:planks`, and you hold `cherry_planks`, you may use it directly as input.\\n\\n2Ôºâ Craft Feasibility Check:\\n- Before you use `Action: craft_recipe_check`, you must **verify that your current hand has all required ingredients in sufficient quantities**.\\n- Recipes that are correct in logic but **unfeasible with your current inventory** will be rejected.\\n- To avoid this, always extract your current hand from the latest game log and/or use `possible_recipes_from_hand` to ensure your plan is executable at this moment.\\n\\n3Ôºâ Strict Recipe Matching:\\n- You must use **the exact input/output ratio** as defined in the recipe. For example, if crafting sticks requires:\\n  - `\\\"input\\\": \\\"#planks\\\": 2, \\\"output\\\": \\\"stick\\\": 4\\\"`, then don't use 1 plank and expecting 2 sticks.\\n- **Do not downscale or fraction the recipe arbitrarily.** Always follow integral crafting rules as listed in item info and recipe outputs.\\n\\n\\n# Game log:\\nHere is major events happened in the game:\\n### Proposing Phase\\nNow it's your turn for proposing.\\n\\n\\n\\nAttention!

  "msg": "{\"text\":\"# Game Setting.\\nYou and your teamates are playing a game called **tradeCraft**, here is the game introduction.  \\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# üèÜ **Winning Condition**\\n1.Focus on crafting your target item as efficiently as possible.\\n2.Support your opponent‚Äôs progress through information-sharing and fair trade.\\n\\n# üå± **Strategy Tips**\\n1. Prioritize trades that create mutual benefit, even at short-term cost to yourself. In this mode, winning requires that both sides progress.\\n2. Openly share insights about item chains, crafting routes, and inferred goals. If you notice the other side may be stuck, offer clues or relevant resources to assist them.\\n3. Transparency and goodwill are essential ‚Äî unlike in competitive play, where bluffing, misdirection, and information hoarding are common tactics, this mode thrives on honest cooperation and trust-building.\\n4. In many other games, teams may deceive, bait, or manipulate their opponents to gain an edge. But here, such tactics undermine collective success. Replace bluffing with clarity, replace probing for secrets with volunteering support.\\n5. Think of your team and the other as allies bound by shared fate: coordination, empathy, and shared planning are your strongest weapons.\\nü§ù ‚ÄúTo win alone is to lose together. To win together is the only victory that matters.‚Äù\\n\\nYour team's username is **gemini_cooperative**.\\nYour are the **crafter** in your team: who should think what your team need, check possible recipes and carry out craft. \\nYou should stick to your **wining condition** and **strategy tips**\\n\\nNow its your turn to act, you must manage to craft some target items. Your team's username name is **gemini_cooperative**.\\nIn this game, crafting follows strictly rule set of *MineCraft*, all ingredients are required, but all related infrastructures are given.\\n\\n# Instructions\\nYou may act following the next steps: \\nstep 1. identify what items should be crafted for your final **winning condition** in your current turn according to history and current state.  \\nstep 2. from the **current state** section, extract YOUR latest hand items.  \\nstep 3. make a detailed plan about what to craft step by step, including in each step what recipes must be used and specify input / output items with their amount. Make sure you follow the guidance of **Special Tips**. You may use tools to help you know what could be crafted and the crafting properties of each item.  \\nstep 4. follow your plan step by step, using correct recipes and assign exact amount of the input / output items. While crafting each item, use tool \\\"craft_recipe_check\\\" to check for recipe correctedness, you may repeatedly checking until it is correct, then use tool \\\"craft_recipe_apply\\\" to apply it.  \\nstep 5. if target is done or mistakes happens, try to run step 3 and step 4, if a repeat does not work, return with \\\"craft_done\\\" and an error message, try to find another strategy to win the game.\\n\\nUse *Final Output:* to tell that you are done with all crafts in this turn.\\n\\n\\n# Strategic Reminder  \\nAt **every step**, especially when writing a *Thought* or deciding what to craft, **always recall your team's winning condition and strategy tips**.  \\nYour crafting plan should **serve the exact goals defined in your current game mode**: whether it is cooperation, competition, or pure self-optimization.  \\nLet your **reasoning, material prioritization, and crafting sequence** all align with your winning logic.\\n\\n## Special tips\\n1Ôºâ Tag Resolution:\\n- **Tags like `minecraft:fuel` or `minecraft:planks` are *not actual items*** ‚Äî they are *categories* used in recipes.\\n- You must **replace any tag** with a valid item from your own hand that belongs to that tag.  \\n    - For example:  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1` = `coal * 1.0` = `cherry_planks * 16/3`  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1/8` = `coal * 0.125` = `cherry_planks * 2/3`\\n- **Never submit a recipe with `\\\"minecraft:fuel\\\"` as an input**. Always substitute it with items like `\\\"coal\\\": 0.125` or `\\\"cherry_planks\\\": 0.667`.\\n- Similarly, if a recipe uses `#minecraft:planks`, and you hold `cherry_planks`, you may use it directly as input.\\n\\n2Ôºâ Craft Feasibility Check:\\n- Before you use `Action: craft_recipe_check`, you must **verify that your current hand has all required ingredients in sufficient quantities**.\\n- Recipes that are correct in logic but **unfeasible with your current inventory** will be rejected.\\n- To avoid this, always extract your current hand from the latest game log and/or use `possible_recipes_from_hand` to ensure your plan is executable at this moment.\\n\\n3Ôºâ Strict Recipe Matching:\\n- You must use **the exact input/output ratio** as defined in the recipe. For example, if crafting sticks requires:\\n  - `\\\"input\\\": \\\"#planks\\\": 2, \\\"output\\\": \\\"stick\\\": 4\\\"`, then don't use 1 plank and expecting 2 sticks.\\n- **Do not downscale or fraction the recipe arbitrarily.** Always follow integral crafting rules as listed in item info and recipe outputs.\\n\\n\\n# Game log:\\nHere is major events happened in the game:\\n### Proposing Phase\\nNow it's your turn for proposing.\\n\\n\\n\\nAttention!

  "msg": "{\"text\":\"# Game Setting.\\nYou and your teamates are playing a game called **tradeCraft**, here is the game introduction.  \\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# üèÜ **Winning Condition**\\n1.Focus on crafting your target item as efficiently as possible.\\n2.Support your opponent‚Äôs progress through information-sharing and fair trade.\\n\\n# üå± **Strategy Tips**\\n1. Prioritize trades that create mutual benefit, even at short-term cost to yourself. In this mode, winning requires that both sides progress.\\n2. Openly share insights about item chains, crafting routes, and inferred goals. If you notice the other side may be stuck, offer clues or relevant resources to assist them.\\n3. Transparency and goodwill are essential ‚Äî unlike in competitive play, where bluffing, misdirection, and information hoarding are common tactics, this mode thrives on honest cooperation and trust-building.\\n4. In many other games, teams may deceive, bait, or manipulate their opponents to gain an edge. But here, such tactics undermine collective success. Replace bluffing with clarity, replace probing for secrets with volunteering support.\\n5. Think of your team and the other as allies bound by shared fate: coordination, empathy, and shared planning are your strongest weapons.\\nü§ù ‚ÄúTo win alone is to lose together. To win together is the only victory that matters.‚Äù\\n\\nYour team's username is **gemini_cooperative**.\\nYour are the **crafter** in your team: who should think what your team need, check possible recipes and carry out craft. \\nYou should stick to your **wining condition** and **strategy tips**\\n\\nNow its your turn to act, you must manage to craft some target items. Your team's username name is **gemini_cooperative**.\\nIn this game, crafting follows strictly rule set of *MineCraft*, all ingredients are required, but all related infrastructures are given.\\n\\n# Instructions\\nYou may act following the next steps: \\nstep 1. identify what items should be crafted for your final **winning condition** in your current turn according to history and current state.  \\nstep 2. from the **current state** section, extract YOUR latest hand items.  \\nstep 3. make a detailed plan about what to craft step by step, including in each step what recipes must be used and specify input / output items with their amount. Make sure you follow the guidance of **Special Tips**. You may use tools to help you know what could be crafted and the crafting properties of each item.  \\nstep 4. follow your plan step by step, using correct recipes and assign exact amount of the input / output items. While crafting each item, use tool \\\"craft_recipe_check\\\" to check for recipe correctedness, you may repeatedly checking until it is correct, then use tool \\\"craft_recipe_apply\\\" to apply it.  \\nstep 5. if target is done or mistakes happens, try to run step 3 and step 4, if a repeat does not work, return with \\\"craft_done\\\" and an error message, try to find another strategy to win the game.\\n\\nUse *Final Output:* to tell that you are done with all crafts in this turn.\\n\\n\\n# Strategic Reminder  \\nAt **every step**, especially when writing a *Thought* or deciding what to craft, **always recall your team's winning condition and strategy tips**.  \\nYour crafting plan should **serve the exact goals defined in your current game mode**: whether it is cooperation, competition, or pure self-optimization.  \\nLet your **reasoning, material prioritization, and crafting sequence** all align with your winning logic.\\n\\n## Special tips\\n1Ôºâ Tag Resolution:\\n- **Tags like `minecraft:fuel` or `minecraft:planks` are *not actual items*** ‚Äî they are *categories* used in recipes.\\n- You must **replace any tag** with a valid item from your own hand that belongs to that tag.  \\n    - For example:  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1` = `coal * 1.0` = `cherry_planks * 16/3`  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1/8` = `coal * 0.125` = `cherry_planks * 2/3`\\n- **Never submit a recipe with `\\\"minecraft:fuel\\\"` as an input**. Always substitute it with items like `\\\"coal\\\": 0.125` or `\\\"cherry_planks\\\": 0.667`.\\n- Similarly, if a recipe uses `#minecraft:planks`, and you hold `cherry_planks`, you may use it directly as input.\\n\\n2Ôºâ Craft Feasibility Check:\\n- Before you use `Action: craft_recipe_check`, you must **verify that your current hand has all required ingredients in sufficient quantities**.\\n- Recipes that are correct in logic but **unfeasible with your current inventory** will be rejected.\\n- To avoid this, always extract your current hand from the latest game log and/or use `possible_recipes_from_hand` to ensure your plan is executable at this moment.\\n\\n3Ôºâ Strict Recipe Matching:\\n- You must use **the exact input/output ratio** as defined in the recipe. For example, if crafting sticks requires:\\n  - `\\\"input\\\": \\\"#planks\\\": 2, \\\"output\\\": \\\"stick\\\": 4\\\"`, then don't use 1 plank and expecting 2 sticks.\\n- **Do not downscale or fraction the recipe arbitrarily.** Always follow integral crafting rules as listed in item info and recipe outputs.\\n\\n\\n# Game log:\\nHere is major events happened in the game:\\n### Proposing Phase\\nNow it's your turn for proposing.\\n\\n\\n\\nAttention!

  "msg": "{\"text\":\"# Game Setting.\\nYou and your teamates are playing a game called **tradeCraft**, here is the game introduction.  \\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# üèÜ **Winning Condition**\\n1.Focus on crafting your target item as efficiently as possible.\\n2.Support your opponent‚Äôs progress through information-sharing and fair trade.\\n\\n# üå± **Strategy Tips**\\n1. Prioritize trades that create mutual benefit, even at short-term cost to yourself. In this mode, winning requires that both sides progress.\\n2. Openly share insights about item chains, crafting routes, and inferred goals. If you notice the other side may be stuck, offer clues or relevant resources to assist them.\\n3. Transparency and goodwill are essential ‚Äî unlike in competitive play, where bluffing, misdirection, and information hoarding are common tactics, this mode thrives on honest cooperation and trust-building.\\n4. In many other games, teams may deceive, bait, or manipulate their opponents to gain an edge. But here, such tactics undermine collective success. Replace bluffing with clarity, replace probing for secrets with volunteering support.\\n5. Think of your team and the other as allies bound by shared fate: coordination, empathy, and shared planning are your strongest weapons.\\nü§ù ‚ÄúTo win alone is to lose together.

Make sure you follow the guidance of **Special Tips**. You may use tools to help you know what could be crafted and the crafting properties of each item.  \\nstep 4. follow your plan step by step, using correct recipes and assign exact amount of the input / output items. While crafting each item, use tool \\\"craft_recipe_check\\\" to check for recipe correctedness, you may repeatedly checking until it is correct, then use tool \\\"craft_recipe_apply\\\" to apply it.  \\nstep 5. if target is done or mistakes happens, try to run step 3 and step 4, if a repeat does not work, return with \\\"craft_done\\\" and an error message, try to find another strategy to win the game.\\n\\nUse *Final Output:* to tell that you are done with all crafts in this turn.\\n\\n\\n# Strategic Reminder  \\nAt **every step**, especially when writing a *Thought* or deciding what to craft, **always recall your team's winning condition and strategy tips**.  \\nYour crafting plan should **serve the exact goals defined in your current game mode**: whether it is cooperation, competition, or pure self-optimization.  \\nLet your **reasoning, material prioritization, and crafting sequence** all align with your winning logic.\\n\\n## Special tips\\n1Ôºâ Tag Resolution:\\n- **Tags like `minecraft:fuel` or `minecraft:planks` are *not actual items*** ‚Äî they are *categories* used in recipes.\\n- You must **replace any tag** with a valid item from your own hand that belongs to that tag.  \\n    - For example:  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1` = `coal * 1.0` = `cherry_planks * 16/3`  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1/8` = `coal * 0.125` = `cherry_planks * 2/3`\\n- **Never submit a recipe with `\\\"minecraft:fuel\\\"` as an input**. Always substitute it with items like `\\\"coal\\\": 0.125` or `\\\"cherry_planks\\\": 0.667`.\\n- Similarly, if a recipe uses `#minecraft:planks`, and you hold `cherry_planks`, you may use it directly as input.\\n\\n2Ôºâ Craft Feasibility Check:\\n- Before you use `Action: craft_recipe_check`, you must **verify that your current hand has all required ingredients in sufficient quantities**.\\n- Recipes that are correct in logic but **unfeasible with your current inventory** will be rejected.\\n- To avoid this, always extract your current hand from the latest game log and/or use `possible_recipes_from_hand` to ensure your plan is executable at this moment.\\n\\n3Ôºâ Strict Recipe Matching:\\n- You must use **the exact input/output ratio** as defined in the recipe. For example, if crafting sticks requires:\\n  - `\\\"input\\\": \\\"#planks\\\": 2, \\\"output\\\": \\\"stick\\\": 4\\\"`, then don't use 1 plank and expecting 2 sticks.\\n- **Do not downscale or fraction the recipe arbitrarily.** Always follow integral crafting rules as listed in item info and recipe outputs.\\n\\n\\n# Game log:\\nHere is major events happened in the game:\\n### Proposing Phase\\nNow it's your turn for proposing.\\n\\n\\n\\nAttention!

  "msg": "{\"text\":\"# Game Setting.\\nYou and your teamates are playing a game called **tradeCraft**, here is the game introduction.  \\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# üèÜ **Winning Condition**\\n1.Focus on crafting your target item as efficiently as possible.\\n2.Support your opponent‚Äôs progress through information-sharing and fair trade.\\n\\n# üå± **Strategy Tips**\\n1. Prioritize trades that create mutual benefit, even at short-term cost to yourself. In this mode, winning requires that both sides progress.\\n2. Openly share insights about item chains, crafting routes, and inferred goals. If you notice the other side may be stuck, offer clues or relevant resources to assist them.\\n3. Transparency and goodwill are essential ‚Äî unlike in competitive play, where bluffing, misdirection, and information hoarding are common tactics, this mode thrives on honest cooperation and trust-building.\\n4. In many other games, teams may deceive, bait, or manipulate their opponents to gain an edge. But here, such tactics undermine collective success. Replace bluffing with clarity, replace probing for secrets with volunteering support.\\n5.

  "msg": "{\"text\":\"# Game Setting.\\nYou and your teamates are playing a game called **tradeCraft**, here is the game introduction.  \\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# üèÜ **Winning Condition**\\n1.Focus on crafting your target item as efficiently as possible.\\n2.Support your opponent‚Äôs progress through information-sharing and fair trade.\\n\\n# üå± **Strategy Tips**\\n1. Prioritize trades that create mutual benefit, even at short-term cost to yourself. In this mode, winning requires that both sides progress.\\n2. Openly share insights about item chains, crafting routes, and inferred goals. If you notice the other side may be stuck, offer clues or relevant resources to assist them.\\n3. Transparency and goodwill are essential ‚Äî unlike in competitive play, where bluffing, misdirection, and information hoarding are common tactics, this mode thrives on honest cooperation and trust-building.\\n4. In many other games, teams may deceive, bait, or manipulate their opponents to gain an edge. But here, such tactics undermine collective success. Replace bluffing with clarity, replace probing for secrets with volunteering support.\\n5. Think of your team and the other as allies bound by shared fate: coordination, empathy, and shared planning are your strongest weapons.\\nü§ù ‚ÄúTo win alone is to lose together.

Your team's username is **gemini_cooperative**.\\n\\n# Game introduction\\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# üèÜ **Winning Condition**\\n1.Focus on crafting your target item as efficiently as possible.\\n2.Support your opponent‚Äôs progress through information-sharing and fair trade.\\n\\n# üå± **Strategy Tips**\\n1. Prioritize trades that create mutual benefit, even at short-term cost to yourself. In this mode, winning requires that both sides progress.\\n2. Openly share insights about item chains, crafting routes, and inferred goals. If you notice the other side may be stuck, offer clues or relevant resources to assist them.\\n3. Transparency and goodwill are essential ‚Äî unlike in competitive play, where bluffing, misdirection, and information hoarding are common tactics, this mode thrives on honest cooperation and trust-building.\\n4. In many other games, teams may deceive, bait, or manipulate their opponents to gain an edge. But here, such tactics undermine collective success. Replace bluffing with clarity, replace probing for secrets with volunteering support.\\n5. Think of your team and the other as allies bound by shared fate: coordination, empathy, and shared planning are your strongest weapons.\\nü§ù ‚ÄúTo win alone is to lose together.

You should:\\n- Focus on the most recent player actions and state updates.\\n- Ignore repeated or irrelevant exchanges.\\n- Pay attention to any item changes, successful trades, and crafting results.\\n- Note that the entire observation is time-ordered: it starts from the beginning of the game and ends at the current turn.\\n## Special tips\\n1Ôºâ Tag Resolution:\\n- **Tags like `minecraft:fuel` or `minecraft:planks` are *not actual items*** ‚Äî they are *categories* used in recipes.\\n- You must **replace any tag** with a valid item from your own hand that belongs to that tag.  \\n    - For example:  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1` = `coal * 1.0` = `cherry_planks * 16/3`  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1/8` = `coal * 0.125` = `cherry_planks * 2/3`\\n- **Never submit a recipe with `\\\"minecraft:fuel\\\"` as an input**. Always substitute it with items like `\\\"coal\\\": 0.125` or `\\\"cherry_planks\\\": 0.667`.\\n- Similarly, if a recipe uses `#minecraft:planks`, and you hold `cherry_planks`, you may use it directly as input.\\n2Ôºâ Strict Recipe Matching:\\n- You must use **the exact input/output ratio** as defined in the recipe. For example, if crafting sticks requires:\\n  - `\\\"input\\\": \\\"#planks\\\": 2, \\\"output\\\": \\\"stick\\\": 4\\\"`, then don't use 1 plank and expecting 2 sticks.\\n- **Do not downscale or fraction the recipe arbitrarily.** Always follow integral crafting rules as listed in item info and recipe outputs.\\n\\n\\n# Old Plan:\\nHere is the plan you made last time, for your reference: \\nAgent stopped due to iteration limit or time limit.\\n\\nWhen you make a plan, focus on the items you already have, as well as **the items you are targeting**,to make a plan.Now, start making your plan for this turn!\\n\\n\",\"type\":\"StringPromptValue\"}",

Always substitute it with items like `\\\"coal\\\": 0.125` or `\\\"cherry_planks\\\": 0.667`.\\n- Similarly, if a recipe uses `#minecraft:planks`, and you hold `cherry_planks`, you may use it directly as input.\\n2Ôºâ Strict Recipe Matching:\\n- You must use **the exact input/output ratio** as defined in the recipe. For example, if crafting sticks requires:\\n  - `\\\"input\\\": \\\"#planks\\\": 2, \\\"output\\\": \\\"stick\\\": 4\\\"`, then don't use 1 plank and expecting 2 sticks.\\n- **Do not downscale or fraction the recipe arbitrarily.** Always follow integral crafting rules as listed in item info and recipe outputs.\\n\\n\\n# Old Plan:\\nHere is the plan you made last time, for your reference: \\nAgent stopped due to iteration limit or time limit.\\n\\nWhen you make a plan, focus on the items you already have, as well as **the items you are targeting**,to make a plan.Now, start making your plan for this turn!\\nParsing LLM output produced both a final answer and a parse-able action:: Thought: My target is minecraft:iron_pickaxe.

  "msg": "{\"text\":\"You together with your team is playing a game called **tradeCraft**. Your team's username is **gemini_cooperative**.\\n\\n# Game introduction\\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# üèÜ **Winning Condition**\\n1.Focus on crafting your target item as efficiently as possible.\\n2.Support your opponent‚Äôs progress through information-sharing and fair trade.\\n\\n# üå± **Strategy Tips**\\n1. Prioritize trades that create mutual benefit, even at short-term cost to yourself. In this mode, winning requires that both sides progress.\\n2. Openly share insights about item chains, crafting routes, and inferred goals. If you notice the other side may be stuck, offer clues or relevant resources to assist them.\\n3. Transparency and goodwill are essential ‚Äî unlike in competitive play, where bluffing, misdirection, and information hoarding are common tactics, this mode thrives on honest cooperation and trust-building.\\n4. In many other games, teams may deceive, bait, or manipulate their opponents to gain an edge. But here, such tactics undermine collective success. Replace bluffing with clarity, replace probing for secrets with volunteering support.\\n5. Think of your team and the other as allies bound by shared fate: coordination, empathy, and shared planning are your strongest weapons.\\nü§ù ‚ÄúTo win alone is to lose together. To win together is the only victory that matters.‚Äù\\n\\n# Your task:\\n(1) You must **make a plan** for this round, where your immediate goal is to handle the task of **crafting**.\\n(2) You may predict what will happen and think about the best strategy to win. \\n(3) You have your old plan for reference. REMEMBER, **you are planning**, so you may ask for information, but not able to make a proposal / make a decision or do a crafting. \\n(4) And in the output plan, you should use symbol **<current status>** to annotate the border between true game history and the plan / prediction. \\n\\n# Useable tools:\\npossible_recipes_from_hand - Get the list of possible craft recipes affordable by your hand resources.\\n\\n        Args:\\n            messages:dict = {\\\"username\\\": your username}\\nitem_info - Get crafting recipes related to `item_name`.\\n        The return is in format of a string.\\n        First line of return is the recipes which can output the item ({input: ingredients, output: results}),\\n        each item is given as `item_name:item_value` pair, where item_value is a fraction of form {n: number, d: number}\\n        where n s numerator and d represents denominator.\\n        Second line of the return is the recipes where item can be used as input.\\n\\n        Args:\\n            messages:str = \\\"item_name\\\"\\nrethink(messages: str) - Dummy Tool\\n\\nA tool which can buy you another round to rethink.\\nIt accepts any string for inupt and outputs empty string.\\n\\nArgs:\\nmessages = \\\"any string\\\"\\n\\n# Instructions\\n[Important Note 1] In this game, **the amount of the items are important**, you must take care of the exact amount of each item you need in the plan. You may plan by answering the following questions:\\n1. What is my target. What does each player have in hand?\\n2. What are possible ways to craft the target, based on items in all player's hands, how many do I need? Is it still possible for me to craft?\\n3. What must I trade from other players, trade with which item and how many.\\n4. What might other players' targets be? What might others think?\\n5. How to avoid other players' obtaining the target before me?\\n6. How would I use the items?

  "msg": "{\"text\":\"You together with your team is playing a game called **tradeCraft**. Your team's username is **gemini_cooperative**.\\n\\n# Game introduction\\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# üèÜ **Winning Condition**\\n1.Focus on crafting your target item as efficiently as possible.\\n2.Support your opponent‚Äôs progress through information-sharing and fair trade.\\n\\n# üå± **Strategy Tips**\\n1. Prioritize trades that create mutual benefit, even at short-term cost to yourself. In this mode, winning requires that both sides progress.\\n2. Openly share insights about item chains, crafting routes, and inferred goals. If you notice the other side may be stuck, offer clues or relevant resources to assist them.\\n3. Transparency and goodwill are essential ‚Äî unlike in competitive play, where bluffing, misdirection, and information hoarding are common tactics, this mode thrives on honest cooperation and trust-building.\\n4. In many other games, teams may deceive, bait, or manipulate their opponents to gain an edge. But here, such tactics undermine collective success. Replace bluffing with clarity, replace probing for secrets with volunteering support.\\n5. Think of your team and the other as allies bound by shared fate: coordination, empathy, and shared planning are your strongest weapons.\\nü§ù ‚ÄúTo win alone is to lose together. To win together is the only victory that matters.‚Äù\\n\\n# Your task:\\n(1) You must **make a plan** for this round, where your immediate goal is to handle the task of **crafting**.\\n(2) You may predict what will happen and think about the best strategy to win. \\n(3) You have your old plan for reference. REMEMBER, **you are planning**, so you may ask for information, but not able to make a proposal / make a decision or do a crafting. \\n(4) And in the output plan, you should use symbol **<current status>** to annotate the border between true game history and the plan / prediction. \\n\\n# Useable tools:\\npossible_recipes_from_hand - Get the list of possible craft recipes affordable by your hand resources.\\n\\n        Args:\\n            messages:dict = {\\\"username\\\": your username}\\nitem_info - Get crafting recipes related to `item_name`.\\n        The return is in format of a string.\\n        First line of return is the recipes which can output the item ({input: ingredients, output: results}),\\n        each item is given as `item_name:item_value` pair, where item_value is a fraction of form {n: number, d: number}\\n        where n s numerator and d represents denominator.\\n        Second line of the return is the recipes where item can be used as input.\\n\\n        Args:\\n            messages:str = \\\"item_name\\\"\\nrethink(messages: str) - Dummy Tool\\n\\nA tool which can buy you another round to rethink.\\nIt accepts any string for inupt and outputs empty string.\\n\\nArgs:\\nmessages = \\\"any string\\\"\\n\\n# Instructions\\n[Important Note 1] In this game, **the amount of the items are important**, you must take care of the exact amount of each item you need in the plan. You may plan by answering the following questions:\\n1. What is my target. What does each player have in hand?\\n2. What are possible ways to craft the target, based on items in all player's hands, how many do I need? Is it still possible for me to craft?\\n3. What must I trade from other players, trade with which item and how many.\\n4. What might other players' targets be? What might others think?\\n5. How to avoid other players' obtaining the target before me?\\n6. How would I use the items?

  "msg": "{\"text\":\"You together with your team is playing a game called **tradeCraft**. Your team's username is **gemini_cooperative**.\\n\\n# Game introduction\\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# üèÜ **Winning Condition**\\n1.Focus on crafting your target item as efficiently as possible.\\n2.Support your opponent‚Äôs progress through information-sharing and fair trade.\\n\\n# üå± **Strategy Tips**\\n1. Prioritize trades that create mutual benefit, even at short-term cost to yourself. In this mode, winning requires that both sides progress.\\n2. Openly share insights about item chains, crafting routes, and inferred goals. If you notice the other side may be stuck, offer clues or relevant resources to assist them.\\n3. Transparency and goodwill are essential ‚Äî unlike in competitive play, where bluffing, misdirection, and information hoarding are common tactics, this mode thrives on honest cooperation and trust-building.\\n4. In many other games, teams may deceive, bait, or manipulate their opponents to gain an edge. But here, such tactics undermine collective success. Replace bluffing with clarity, replace probing for secrets with volunteering support.\\n5. Think of your team and the other as allies bound by shared fate: coordination, empathy, and shared planning are your strongest weapons.\\nü§ù ‚ÄúTo win alone is to lose together. To win together is the only victory that matters.‚Äù\\n\\n# Your task:\\n(1) You must **make a plan** for this round, where your immediate goal is to handle the task of **crafting**.\\n(2) You may predict what will happen and think about the best strategy to win. \\n(3) You have your old plan for reference. REMEMBER, **you are planning**, so you may ask for information, but not able to make a proposal / make a decision or do a crafting. \\n(4) And in the output plan, you should use symbol **<current status>** to annotate the border between true game history and the plan / prediction. \\n\\n# Useable tools:\\npossible_recipes_from_hand - Get the list of possible craft recipes affordable by your hand resources.\\n\\n        Args:\\n            messages:dict = {\\\"username\\\": your username}\\nitem_info - Get crafting recipes related to `item_name`.\\n        The return is in format of a string.\\n        First line of return is the recipes which can output the item ({input: ingredients, output: results}),\\n        each item is given as `item_name:item_value` pair, where item_value is a fraction of form {n: number, d: number}\\n        where n s numerator and d represents denominator.\\n        Second line of the return is the recipes where item can be used as input.\\n\\n        Args:\\n            messages:str = \\\"item_name\\\"\\nrethink(messages: str) - Dummy Tool\\n\\nA tool which can buy you another round to rethink.\\nIt accepts any string for inupt and outputs empty string.\\n\\nArgs:\\nmessages = \\\"any string\\\"\\n\\n# Instructions\\n[Important Note 1] In this game, **the amount of the items are important**, you must take care of the exact amount of each item you need in the plan. You may plan by answering the following questions:\\n1. What is my target. What does each player have in hand?\\n2. What are possible ways to craft the target, based on items in all player's hands, how many do I need? Is it still possible for me to craft?\\n3. What must I trade from other players, trade with which item and how many.\\n4. What might other players' targets be? What might others think?\\n5. How to avoid other players' obtaining the target before me?\\n6. How would I use the items? Write the crafting plan step by step.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n# Output Format\\n**Your output should strictly follow the format below**, **you MUST use the tags to control the flow**:\\n - Thought: you should always think about what to do\\n - Action: the action you can take, should be one of [possible_recipes_from_hand, item_info, rethink].\\n - Action Input: the input to the action, according to the tool's arguments. \\n - Thought: I think I have a good plan.\\n - Final Output: the most reasonable plan you make for this game and the whole plan you make\\n\\n# Recent Observations & History(Turns Recordings):\\n\\nAttention!

You should:\\n- Focus on the most recent player actions and state updates.\\n- Ignore repeated or irrelevant exchanges.\\n- Pay attention to any item changes, successful trades, and crafting results.\\n- Note that the entire observation is time-ordered: it starts from the beginning of the game and ends at the current turn.\\n## Special tips\\n1Ôºâ Tag Resolution:\\n- **Tags like `minecraft:fuel` or `minecraft:planks` are *not actual items*** ‚Äî they are *categories* used in recipes.\\n- You must **replace any tag** with a valid item from your own hand that belongs to that tag.  \\n    - For example:  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1` = `coal * 1.0` = `cherry_planks * 16/3`  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1/8` = `coal * 0.125` = `cherry_planks * 2/3`\\n- **Never submit a recipe with `\\\"minecraft:fuel\\\"` as an input**. Always substitute it with items like `\\\"coal\\\": 0.125` or `\\\"cherry_planks\\\": 0.667`.\\n- Similarly, if a recipe uses `#minecraft:planks`, and you hold `cherry_planks`, you may use it directly as input.\\n2Ôºâ Strict Recipe Matching:\\n- You must use **the exact input/output ratio** as defined in the recipe. For example, if crafting sticks requires:\\n  - `\\\"input\\\": \\\"#planks\\\": 2, \\\"output\\\": \\\"stick\\\": 4\\\"`, then don't use 1 plank and expecting 2 sticks.\\n- **Do not downscale or fraction the recipe arbitrarily.** Always follow integral crafting rules as listed in item info and recipe outputs.\\n\\n\\n# Old Plan:\\nHere is the plan you made last time, for your reference: \\nAgent stopped due to iteration limit or time limit.\\n\\nWhen you make a plan, focus on the items you already have, as well as **the items you are targeting**,to make a plan.Now, start making your plan for this turn!\\nParsing LLM output produced both a final answer and a parse-able action:: Thought: My target is minecraft:iron_pickaxe.

  "msg": "{\"text\":\"# Game Setting.\\nYou and your teamates are playing a game called **tradeCraft**, here is the game introduction.  \\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# üèÜ **Winning Condition**\\n1.Focus on crafting your target item as efficiently as possible.\\n2.Support your opponent‚Äôs progress through information-sharing and fair trade.\\n\\n# üå± **Strategy Tips**\\n1. Prioritize trades that create mutual benefit, even at short-term cost to yourself. In this mode, winning requires that both sides progress.\\n2. Openly share insights about item chains, crafting routes, and inferred goals. If you notice the other side may be stuck, offer clues or relevant resources to assist them.\\n3. Transparency and goodwill are essential ‚Äî unlike in competitive play, where bluffing, misdirection, and information hoarding are common tactics, this mode thrives on honest cooperation and trust-building.\\n4. In many other games, teams may deceive, bait, or manipulate their opponents to gain an edge. But here, such tactics undermine collective success. Replace bluffing with clarity, replace probing for secrets with volunteering support.\\n5. Think of your team and the other as allies bound by shared fate: coordination, empathy, and shared planning are your strongest weapons.\\nü§ù ‚ÄúTo win alone is to lose together. To win together is the only victory that matters.‚Äù\\n\\nYour team's username is **gemini_cooperative**.\\nYour are the **crafter** in your team: who should think what your team need, check possible recipes and carry out craft. \\nYou should stick to your **wining condition** and **strategy tips**\\n\\nNow its your turn to act, you must manage to craft some target items. Your team's username name is **gemini_cooperative**.\\nIn this game, crafting follows strictly rule set of *MineCraft*, all ingredients are required, but all related infrastructures are given.\\n\\n# Instructions\\nYou may act following the next steps: \\nstep 1. identify what items should be crafted for your final **winning condition** in your current turn according to history and current state.  \\nstep 2. from the **current state** section, extract YOUR latest hand items.  \\nstep 3. make a detailed plan about what to craft step by step, including in each step what recipes must be used and specify input / output items with their amount. Make sure you follow the guidance of **Special Tips**. You may use tools to help you know what could be crafted and the crafting properties of each item.  \\nstep 4. follow your plan step by step, using correct recipes and assign exact amount of the input / output items. While crafting each item, use tool \\\"craft_recipe_check\\\" to check for recipe correctedness, you may repeatedly checking until it is correct, then use tool \\\"craft_recipe_apply\\\" to apply it.  \\nstep 5. if target is done or mistakes happens, try to run step 3 and step 4, if a repeat does not work, return with \\\"craft_done\\\" and an error message, try to find another strategy to win the game.\\n\\nUse *Final Output:* to tell that you are done with all crafts in this turn.\\n\\n\\n# Strategic Reminder  \\nAt **every step**, especially when writing a *Thought* or deciding what to craft, **always recall your team's winning condition and strategy tips**.  \\nYour crafting plan should **serve the exact goals defined in your current game mode**: whether it is cooperation, competition, or pure self-optimization.  \\nLet your **reasoning, material prioritization, and crafting sequence** all align with your winning logic.\\n\\n## Special tips\\n1Ôºâ Tag Resolution:\\n- **Tags like `minecraft:fuel` or `minecraft:planks` are *not actual items*** ‚Äî they are *categories* used in recipes.\\n- You must **replace any tag** with a valid item from your own hand that belongs to that tag.  \\n    - For example:  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1` = `coal * 1.0` = `cherry_planks * 16/3`  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1/8` = `coal * 0.125` = `cherry_planks * 2/3`\\n- **Never submit a recipe with `\\\"minecraft:fuel\\\"` as an input**. Always substitute it with items like `\\\"coal\\\": 0.125` or `\\\"cherry_planks\\\": 0.667`.\\n- Similarly, if a recipe uses `#minecraft:planks`, and you hold `cherry_planks`, you may use it directly as input.\\n\\n2Ôºâ Craft Feasibility Check:\\n- Before you use `Action: craft_recipe_check`, you must **verify that your current hand has all required ingredients in sufficient quantities**.\\n- Recipes that are correct in logic but **unfeasible with your current inventory** will be rejected.\\n- To avoid this, always extract your current hand from the latest game log and/or use `possible_recipes_from_hand` to ensure your plan is executable at this moment.\\n\\n3Ôºâ Strict Recipe Matching:\\n- You must use **the exact input/output ratio** as defined in the recipe. For example, if crafting sticks requires:\\n  - `\\\"input\\\": \\\"#planks\\\": 2, \\\"output\\\": \\\"stick\\\": 4\\\"`, then don't use 1 plank and expecting 2 sticks.\\n- **Do not downscale or fraction the recipe arbitrarily.** Always follow integral crafting rules as listed in item info and recipe outputs.\\n\\n\\n# Game log:\\nHere is major events happened in the game:\\n\\nAttention!

  "msg": "{\"text\":\"# Game Setting.\\nYou and your teamates are playing a game called **tradeCraft**, here is the game introduction.  \\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# üèÜ **Winning Condition**\\n1.Focus on crafting your target item as efficiently as possible.\\n2.Support your opponent‚Äôs progress through information-sharing and fair trade.\\n\\n# üå± **Strategy Tips**\\n1. Prioritize trades that create mutual benefit, even at short-term cost to yourself. In this mode, winning requires that both sides progress.\\n2. Openly share insights about item chains, crafting routes, and inferred goals. If you notice the other side may be stuck, offer clues or relevant resources to assist them.\\n3. Transparency and goodwill are essential ‚Äî unlike in competitive play, where bluffing, misdirection, and information hoarding are common tactics, this mode thrives on honest cooperation and trust-building.\\n4. In many other games, teams may deceive, bait, or manipulate their opponents to gain an edge. But here, such tactics undermine collective success. Replace bluffing with clarity, replace probing for secrets with volunteering support.\\n5. Think of your team and the other as allies bound by shared fate: coordination, empathy, and shared planning are your strongest weapons.\\nü§ù ‚ÄúTo win alone is to lose together. To win together is the only victory that matters.‚Äù\\n\\nYour team's username is **gemini_cooperative**.\\nYour are the **crafter** in your team: who should think what your team need, check possible recipes and carry out craft. \\nYou should stick to your **wining condition** and **strategy tips**\\n\\nNow its your turn to act, you must manage to craft some target items. Your team's username name is **gemini_cooperative**.\\nIn this game, crafting follows strictly rule set of *MineCraft*, all ingredients are required, but all related infrastructures are given.\\n\\n# Instructions\\nYou may act following the next steps: \\nstep 1. identify what items should be crafted for your final **winning condition** in your current turn according to history and current state.  \\nstep 2. from the **current state** section, extract YOUR latest hand items.  \\nstep 3. make a detailed plan about what to craft step by step, including in each step what recipes must be used and specify input / output items with their amount. Make sure you follow the guidance of **Special Tips**. You may use tools to help you know what could be crafted and the crafting properties of each item.  \\nstep 4. follow your plan step by step, using correct recipes and assign exact amount of the input / output items. While crafting each item, use tool \\\"craft_recipe_check\\\" to check for recipe correctedness, you may repeatedly checking until it is correct, then use tool \\\"craft_recipe_apply\\\" to apply it.  \\nstep 5. if target is done or mistakes happens, try to run step 3 and step 4, if a repeat does not work, return with \\\"craft_done\\\" and an error message, try to find another strategy to win the game.\\n\\nUse *Final Output:* to tell that you are done with all crafts in this turn.\\n\\n\\n# Strategic Reminder  \\nAt **every step**, especially when writing a *Thought* or deciding what to craft, **always recall your team's winning condition and strategy tips**.  \\nYour crafting plan should **serve the exact goals defined in your current game mode**: whether it is cooperation, competition, or pure self-optimization.  \\nLet your **reasoning, material prioritization, and crafting sequence** all align with your winning logic.\\n\\n## Special tips\\n1Ôºâ Tag Resolution:\\n- **Tags like `minecraft:fuel` or `minecraft:planks` are *not actual items*** ‚Äî they are *categories* used in recipes.\\n- You must **replace any tag** with a valid item from your own hand that belongs to that tag.  \\n    - For example:  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1` = `coal * 1.0` = `cherry_planks * 16/3`  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1/8` = `coal * 0.125` = `cherry_planks * 2/3`\\n- **Never submit a recipe with `\\\"minecraft:fuel\\\"` as an input**. Always substitute it with items like `\\\"coal\\\": 0.125` or `\\\"cherry_planks\\\": 0.667`.\\n- Similarly, if a recipe uses `#minecraft:planks`, and you hold `cherry_planks`, you may use it directly as input.\\n\\n2Ôºâ Craft Feasibility Check:\\n- Before you use `Action: craft_recipe_check`, you must **verify that your current hand has all required ingredients in sufficient quantities**.\\n- Recipes that are correct in logic but **unfeasible with your current inventory** will be rejected.\\n- To avoid this, always extract your current hand from the latest game log and/or use `possible_recipes_from_hand` to ensure your plan is executable at this moment.\\n\\n3Ôºâ Strict Recipe Matching:\\n- You must use **the exact input/output ratio** as defined in the recipe. For example, if crafting sticks requires:\\n  - `\\\"input\\\": \\\"#planks\\\": 2, \\\"output\\\": \\\"stick\\\": 4\\\"`, then don't use 1 plank and expecting 2 sticks.\\n- **Do not downscale or fraction the recipe arbitrarily.** Always follow integral crafting rules as listed in item info and recipe outputs.\\n\\n\\n# Game log:\\nHere is major events happened in the game:\\n\\nAttention!

  "msg": "{\"text\":\"# Game Setting.\\nYou and your teamates are playing a game called **tradeCraft**, here is the game introduction.  \\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# üèÜ **Winning Condition**\\n1.Focus on crafting your target item as efficiently as possible.\\n2.Support your opponent‚Äôs progress through information-sharing and fair trade.\\n\\n# üå± **Strategy Tips**\\n1. Prioritize trades that create mutual benefit, even at short-term cost to yourself. In this mode, winning requires that both sides progress.\\n2. Openly share insights about item chains, crafting routes, and inferred goals. If you notice the other side may be stuck, offer clues or relevant resources to assist them.\\n3. Transparency and goodwill are essential ‚Äî unlike in competitive play, where bluffing, misdirection, and information hoarding are common tactics, this mode thrives on honest cooperation and trust-building.\\n4. In many other games, teams may deceive, bait, or manipulate their opponents to gain an edge. But here, such tactics undermine collective success. Replace bluffing with clarity, replace probing for secrets with volunteering support.\\n5. Think of your team and the other as allies bound by shared fate: coordination, empathy, and shared planning are your strongest weapons.\\nü§ù ‚ÄúTo win alone is to lose together. To win together is the only victory that matters.‚Äù\\n\\nYour team's username is **gemini_cooperative**.\\nYour are the **crafter** in your team: who should think what your team need, check possible recipes and carry out craft. \\nYou should stick to your **wining condition** and **strategy tips**\\n\\nNow its your turn to act, you must manage to craft some target items. Your team's username name is **gemini_cooperative**.\\nIn this game, crafting follows strictly rule set of *MineCraft*, all ingredients are required, but all related infrastructures are given.\\n\\n# Instructions\\nYou may act following the next steps: \\nstep 1. identify what items should be crafted for your final **winning condition** in your current turn according to history and current state.  \\nstep 2. from the **current state** section, extract YOUR latest hand items.  \\nstep 3. make a detailed plan about what to craft step by step, including in each step what recipes must be used and specify input / output items with their amount. Make sure you follow the guidance of **Special Tips**. You may use tools to help you know what could be crafted and the crafting properties of each item.  \\nstep 4. follow your plan step by step, using correct recipes and assign exact amount of the input / output items. While crafting each item, use tool \\\"craft_recipe_check\\\" to check for recipe correctedness, you may repeatedly checking until it is correct, then use tool \\\"craft_recipe_apply\\\" to apply it.  \\nstep 5. if target is done or mistakes happens, try to run step 3 and step 4, if a repeat does not work, return with \\\"craft_done\\\" and an error message, try to find another strategy to win the game.\\n\\nUse *Final Output:* to tell that you are done with all crafts in this turn.\\n\\n\\n# Strategic Reminder  \\nAt **every step**, especially when writing a *Thought* or deciding what to craft, **always recall your team's winning condition and strategy tips**.  \\nYour crafting plan should **serve the exact goals defined in your current game mode**: whether it is cooperation, competition, or pure self-optimization.  \\nLet your **reasoning, material prioritization, and crafting sequence** all align with your winning logic.\\n\\n## Special tips\\n1Ôºâ Tag Resolution:\\n- **Tags like `minecraft:fuel` or `minecraft:planks` are *not actual items*** ‚Äî they are *categories* used in recipes.\\n- You must **replace any tag** with a valid item from your own hand that belongs to that tag.  \\n    - For example:  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1` = `coal * 1.0` = `cherry_planks * 16/3`  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1/8` = `coal * 0.125` = `cherry_planks * 2/3`\\n- **Never submit a recipe with `\\\"minecraft:fuel\\\"` as an input**. Always substitute it with items like `\\\"coal\\\": 0.125` or `\\\"cherry_planks\\\": 0.667`.\\n- Similarly, if a recipe uses `#minecraft:planks`, and you hold `cherry_planks`, you may use it directly as input.\\n\\n2Ôºâ Craft Feasibility Check:\\n- Before you use `Action: craft_recipe_check`, you must **verify that your current hand has all required ingredients in sufficient quantities**.\\n- Recipes that are correct in logic but **unfeasible with your current inventory** will be rejected.\\n- To avoid this, always extract your current hand from the latest game log and/or use `possible_recipes_from_hand` to ensure your plan is executable at this moment.\\n\\n3Ôºâ Strict Recipe Matching:\\n- You must use **the exact input/output ratio** as defined in the recipe. For example, if crafting sticks requires:\\n  - `\\\"input\\\": \\\"#planks\\\": 2, \\\"output\\\": \\\"stick\\\": 4\\\"`, then don't use 1 plank and expecting 2 sticks.\\n- **Do not downscale or fraction the recipe arbitrarily.** Always follow integral crafting rules as listed in item info and recipe outputs.\\n\\n\\n# Game log:\\nHere is major events happened in the game:\\n\\nAttention!

  "msg": "{\"text\":\"# Game Setting.\\nYou and your teamates are playing a game called **tradeCraft**, here is the game introduction.  \\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# üèÜ **Winning Condition**\\n1.Focus on crafting your target item as efficiently as possible.\\n2.Support your opponent‚Äôs progress through information-sharing and fair trade.\\n\\n# üå± **Strategy Tips**\\n1. Prioritize trades that create mutual benefit, even at short-term cost to yourself. In this mode, winning requires that both sides progress.\\n2. Openly share insights about item chains, crafting routes, and inferred goals. If you notice the other side may be stuck, offer clues or relevant resources to assist them.\\n3. Transparency and goodwill are essential ‚Äî unlike in competitive play, where bluffing, misdirection, and information hoarding are common tactics, this mode thrives on honest cooperation and trust-building.\\n4. In many other games, teams may deceive, bait, or manipulate their opponents to gain an edge. But here, such tactics undermine collective success. Replace bluffing with clarity, replace probing for secrets with volunteering support.\\n5. Think of your team and the other as allies bound by shared fate: coordination, empathy, and shared planning are your strongest weapons.\\nü§ù ‚ÄúTo win alone is to lose together. To win together is the only victory that matters.‚Äù\\n\\nYour team's username is **gemini_cooperative**.\\nYour are the **crafter** in your team: who should think what your team need, check possible recipes and carry out craft. \\nYou should stick to your **wining condition** and **strategy tips**\\n\\nNow its your turn to act, you must manage to craft some target items. Your team's username name is **gemini_cooperative**.\\nIn this game, crafting follows strictly rule set of *MineCraft*, all ingredients are required, but all related infrastructures are given.\\n\\n# Instructions\\nYou may act following the next steps: \\nstep 1. identify what items should be crafted for your final **winning condition** in your current turn according to history and current state.  \\nstep 2. from the **current state** section, extract YOUR latest hand items.  \\nstep 3. make a detailed plan about what to craft step by step, including in each step what recipes must be used and specify input / output items with their amount. Make sure you follow the guidance of **Special Tips**. You may use tools to help you know what could be crafted and the crafting properties of each item.  \\nstep 4. follow your plan step by step, using correct recipes and assign exact amount of the input / output items. While crafting each item, use tool \\\"craft_recipe_check\\\" to check for recipe correctedness, you may repeatedly checking until it is correct, then use tool \\\"craft_recipe_apply\\\" to apply it.  \\nstep 5. if target is done or mistakes happens, try to run step 3 and step 4, if a repeat does not work, return with \\\"craft_done\\\" and an error message, try to find another strategy to win the game.\\n\\nUse *Final Output:* to tell that you are done with all crafts in this turn.\\n\\n\\n# Strategic Reminder  \\nAt **every step**, especially when writing a *Thought* or deciding what to craft, **always recall your team's winning condition and strategy tips**.  \\nYour crafting plan should **serve the exact goals defined in your current game mode**: whether it is cooperation, competition, or pure self-optimization.  \\nLet your **reasoning, material prioritization, and crafting sequence** all align with your winning logic.\\n\\n## Special tips\\n1Ôºâ Tag Resolution:\\n- **Tags like `minecraft:fuel` or `minecraft:planks` are *not actual items*** ‚Äî they are *categories* used in recipes.\\n- You must **replace any tag** with a valid item from your own hand that belongs to that tag.  \\n    - For example:  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1` = `coal * 1.0` = `cherry_planks * 16/3`  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1/8` = `coal * 0.125` = `cherry_planks * 2/3`\\n- **Never submit a recipe with `\\\"minecraft:fuel\\\"` as an input**. Always substitute it with items like `\\\"coal\\\": 0.125` or `\\\"cherry_planks\\\": 0.667`.\\n- Similarly, if a recipe uses `#minecraft:planks`, and you hold `cherry_planks`, you may use it directly as input.\\n\\n2Ôºâ Craft Feasibility Check:\\n- Before you use `Action: craft_recipe_check`, you must **verify that your current hand has all required ingredients in sufficient quantities**.\\n- Recipes that are correct in logic but **unfeasible with your current inventory** will be rejected.\\n- To avoid this, always extract your current hand from the latest game log and/or use `possible_recipes_from_hand` to ensure your plan is executable at this moment.\\n\\n3Ôºâ Strict Recipe Matching:\\n- You must use **the exact input/output ratio** as defined in the recipe. For example, if crafting sticks requires:\\n  - `\\\"input\\\": \\\"#planks\\\": 2, \\\"output\\\": \\\"stick\\\": 4\\\"`, then don't use 1 plank and expecting 2 sticks.\\n- **Do not downscale or fraction the recipe arbitrarily.** Always follow integral crafting rules as listed in item info and recipe outputs.\\n\\n\\n# Game log:\\nHere is major events happened in the game:\\n\\nAttention!

  "msg": "{\"text\":\"# Game Setting.\\nYou and your teamates are playing a game called **tradeCraft**, here is the game introduction.  \\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# üèÜ **Winning Condition**\\n1.Focus on crafting your target item as efficiently as possible.\\n2.Support your opponent‚Äôs progress through information-sharing and fair trade.\\n\\n# üå± **Strategy Tips**\\n1. Prioritize trades that create mutual benefit, even at short-term cost to yourself. In this mode, winning requires that both sides progress.\\n2. Openly share insights about item chains, crafting routes, and inferred goals. If you notice the other side may be stuck, offer clues or relevant resources to assist them.\\n3. Transparency and goodwill are essential ‚Äî unlike in competitive play, where bluffing, misdirection, and information hoarding are common tactics, this mode thrives on honest cooperation and trust-building.\\n4. In many other games, teams may deceive, bait, or manipulate their opponents to gain an edge. But here, such tactics undermine collective success. Replace bluffing with clarity, replace probing for secrets with volunteering support.\\n5. Think of your team and the other as allies bound by shared fate: coordination, empathy, and shared planning are your strongest weapons.\\nü§ù ‚ÄúTo win alone is to lose together. To win together is the only victory that matters.‚Äù\\n\\nYour team's username is **gemini_cooperative**.\\nYour are the **crafter** in your team: who should think what your team need, check possible recipes and carry out craft. \\nYou should stick to your **wining condition** and **strategy tips**\\n\\nNow its your turn to act, you must manage to craft some target items. Your team's username name is **gemini_cooperative**.\\nIn this game, crafting follows strictly rule set of *MineCraft*, all ingredients are required, but all related infrastructures are given.\\n\\n# Instructions\\nYou may act following the next steps: \\nstep 1. identify what items should be crafted for your final **winning condition** in your current turn according to history and current state.  \\nstep 2. from the **current state** section, extract YOUR latest hand items.  \\nstep 3. make a detailed plan about what to craft step by step, including in each step what recipes must be used and specify input / output items with their amount. Make sure you follow the guidance of **Special Tips**. You may use tools to help you know what could be crafted and the crafting properties of each item.  \\nstep 4. follow your plan step by step, using correct recipes and assign exact amount of the input / output items. While crafting each item, use tool \\\"craft_recipe_check\\\" to check for recipe correctedness, you may repeatedly checking until it is correct, then use tool \\\"craft_recipe_apply\\\" to apply it.  \\nstep 5. if target is done or mistakes happens, try to run step 3 and step 4, if a repeat does not work, return with \\\"craft_done\\\" and an error message, try to find another strategy to win the game.\\n\\nUse *Final Output:* to tell that you are done with all crafts in this turn.\\n\\n\\n# Strategic Reminder  \\nAt **every step**, especially when writing a *Thought* or deciding what to craft, **always recall your team's winning condition and strategy tips**.  \\nYour crafting plan should **serve the exact goals defined in your current game mode**: whether it is cooperation, competition, or pure self-optimization.  \\nLet your **reasoning, material prioritization, and crafting sequence** all align with your winning logic.\\n\\n## Special tips\\n1Ôºâ Tag Resolution:\\n- **Tags like `minecraft:fuel` or `minecraft:planks` are *not actual items*** ‚Äî they are *categories* used in recipes.\\n- You must **replace any tag** with a valid item from your own hand that belongs to that tag.  \\n    - For example:  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1` = `coal * 1.0` = `cherry_planks * 16/3`  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1/8` = `coal * 0.125` = `cherry_planks * 2/3`\\n- **Never submit a recipe with `\\\"minecraft:fuel\\\"` as an input**. Always substitute it with items like `\\\"coal\\\": 0.125` or `\\\"cherry_planks\\\": 0.667`.\\n- Similarly, if a recipe uses `#minecraft:planks`, and you hold `cherry_planks`, you may use it directly as input.\\n\\n2Ôºâ Craft Feasibility Check:\\n- Before you use `Action: craft_recipe_check`, you must **verify that your current hand has all required ingredients in sufficient quantities**.\\n- Recipes that are correct in logic but **unfeasible with your current inventory** will be rejected.\\n- To avoid this, always extract your current hand from the latest game log and/or use `possible_recipes_from_hand` to ensure your plan is executable at this moment.\\n\\n3Ôºâ Strict Recipe Matching:\\n- You must use **the exact input/output ratio** as defined in the recipe. For example, if crafting sticks requires:\\n  - `\\\"input\\\": \\\"#planks\\\": 2, \\\"output\\\": \\\"stick\\\": 4\\\"`, then don't use 1 plank and expecting 2 sticks.\\n- **Do not downscale or fraction the recipe arbitrarily.** Always follow integral crafting rules as listed in item info and recipe outputs.\\n\\n\\n# Game log:\\nHere is major events happened in the game:\\n\\nAttention!

  "msg": "{\"text\":\"# Game Setting.\\nYou and your teamates are playing a game called **tradeCraft**, here is the game introduction.  \\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# üèÜ **Winning Condition**\\n1.Focus on crafting your target item as efficiently as possible.\\n2.Support your opponent‚Äôs progress through information-sharing and fair trade.\\n\\n# üå± **Strategy Tips**\\n1. Prioritize trades that create mutual benefit, even at short-term cost to yourself. In this mode, winning requires that both sides progress.\\n2. Openly share insights about item chains, crafting routes, and inferred goals. If you notice the other side may be stuck, offer clues or relevant resources to assist them.\\n3. Transparency and goodwill are essential ‚Äî unlike in competitive play, where bluffing, misdirection, and information hoarding are common tactics, this mode thrives on honest cooperation and trust-building.\\n4. In many other games, teams may deceive, bait, or manipulate their opponents to gain an edge. But here, such tactics undermine collective success. Replace bluffing with clarity, replace probing for secrets with volunteering support.\\n5. Think of your team and the other as allies bound by shared fate: coordination, empathy, and shared planning are your strongest weapons.\\nü§ù ‚ÄúTo win alone is to lose together. To win together is the only victory that matters.‚Äù\\n\\nYour team's username is **gemini_cooperative**.\\nYour are the **crafter** in your team: who should think what your team need, check possible recipes and carry out craft. \\nYou should stick to your **wining condition** and **strategy tips**\\n\\nNow its your turn to act, you must manage to craft some target items. Your team's username name is **gemini_cooperative**.\\nIn this game, crafting follows strictly rule set of *MineCraft*, all ingredients are required, but all related infrastructures are given.\\n\\n# Instructions\\nYou may act following the next steps: \\nstep 1. identify what items should be crafted for your final **winning condition** in your current turn according to history and current state.  \\nstep 2. from the **current state** section, extract YOUR latest hand items.  \\nstep 3. make a detailed plan about what to craft step by step, including in each step what recipes must be used and specify input / output items with their amount. Make sure you follow the guidance of **Special Tips**. You may use tools to help you know what could be crafted and the crafting properties of each item.  \\nstep 4. follow your plan step by step, using correct recipes and assign exact amount of the input / output items. While crafting each item, use tool \\\"craft_recipe_check\\\" to check for recipe correctedness, you may repeatedly checking until it is correct, then use tool \\\"craft_recipe_apply\\\" to apply it.  \\nstep 5. if target is done or mistakes happens, try to run step 3 and step 4, if a repeat does not work, return with \\\"craft_done\\\" and an error message, try to find another strategy to win the game.\\n\\nUse *Final Output:* to tell that you are done with all crafts in this turn.\\n\\n\\n# Strategic Reminder  \\nAt **every step**, especially when writing a *Thought* or deciding what to craft, **always recall your team's winning condition and strategy tips**.  \\nYour crafting plan should **serve the exact goals defined in your current game mode**: whether it is cooperation, competition, or pure self-optimization.  \\nLet your **reasoning, material prioritization, and crafting sequence** all align with your winning logic.\\n\\n## Special tips\\n1Ôºâ Tag Resolution:\\n- **Tags like `minecraft:fuel` or `minecraft:planks` are *not actual items*** ‚Äî they are *categories* used in recipes.\\n- You must **replace any tag** with a valid item from your own hand that belongs to that tag.  \\n    - For example:  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1` = `coal * 1.0` = `cherry_planks * 16/3`  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1/8` = `coal * 0.125` = `cherry_planks * 2/3`\\n- **Never submit a recipe with `\\\"minecraft:fuel\\\"` as an input**. Always substitute it with items like `\\\"coal\\\": 0.125` or `\\\"cherry_planks\\\": 0.667`.\\n- Similarly, if a recipe uses `#minecraft:planks`, and you hold `cherry_planks`, you may use it directly as input.\\n\\n2Ôºâ Craft Feasibility Check:\\n- Before you use `Action: craft_recipe_check`, you must **verify that your current hand has all required ingredients in sufficient quantities**.\\n- Recipes that are correct in logic but **unfeasible with your current inventory** will be rejected.\\n- To avoid this, always extract your current hand from the latest game log and/or use `possible_recipes_from_hand` to ensure your plan is executable at this moment.\\n\\n3Ôºâ Strict Recipe Matching:\\n- You must use **the exact input/output ratio** as defined in the recipe. For example, if crafting sticks requires:\\n  - `\\\"input\\\": \\\"#planks\\\": 2, \\\"output\\\": \\\"stick\\\": 4\\\"`, then don't use 1 plank and expecting 2 sticks.\\n- **Do not downscale or fraction the recipe arbitrarily.** Always follow integral crafting rules as listed in item info and recipe outputs.\\n\\n\\n# Game log:\\nHere is major events happened in the game:\\n\\nAttention!

  "msg": "{\"text\":\"# Game Setting.\\nYou and your teamates are playing a game called **tradeCraft**, here is the game introduction.  \\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# üèÜ **Winning Condition**\\n1.Focus on crafting your target item as efficiently as possible.\\n2.Support your opponent‚Äôs progress through information-sharing and fair trade.\\n\\n# üå± **Strategy Tips**\\n1. Prioritize trades that create mutual benefit, even at short-term cost to yourself. In this mode, winning requires that both sides progress.\\n2. Openly share insights about item chains, crafting routes, and inferred goals. If you notice the other side may be stuck, offer clues or relevant resources to assist them.\\n3. Transparency and goodwill are essential ‚Äî unlike in competitive play, where bluffing, misdirection, and information hoarding are common tactics, this mode thrives on honest cooperation and trust-building.\\n4. In many other games, teams may deceive, bait, or manipulate their opponents to gain an edge. But here, such tactics undermine collective success. Replace bluffing with clarity, replace probing for secrets with volunteering support.\\n5. Think of your team and the other as allies bound by shared fate: coordination, empathy, and shared planning are your strongest weapons.\\nü§ù ‚ÄúTo win alone is to lose together.

  "msg": "{\"text\":\"# Game Setting.\\nYou and your teamates are playing a game called **tradeCraft**, here is the game introduction.  \\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over.

  "msg": "{\"text\":\"You together with your team is playing a game called **tradeCraft**. Your team's username is **gemini_cooperative**.\\n\\n# Game introduction\\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# üèÜ **Winning Condition**\\n1.Focus on crafting your target item as efficiently as possible.\\n2.Support your opponent‚Äôs progress through information-sharing and fair trade.\\n\\n# üå± **Strategy Tips**\\n1. Prioritize trades that create mutual benefit, even at short-term cost to yourself. In this mode, winning requires that both sides progress.\\n2. Openly share insights about item chains, crafting routes, and inferred goals. If you notice the other side may be stuck, offer clues or relevant resources to assist them.\\n3. Transparency and goodwill are essential ‚Äî unlike in competitive play, where bluffing, misdirection, and information hoarding are common tactics, this mode thrives on honest cooperation and trust-building.\\n4. In many other games, teams may deceive, bait, or manipulate their opponents to gain an edge. But here, such tactics undermine collective success. Replace bluffing with clarity, replace probing for secrets with volunteering support.\\n5. Think of your team and the other as allies bound by shared fate: coordination, empathy, and shared planning are your strongest weapons.\\nü§ù ‚ÄúTo win alone is to lose together. To win together is the only victory that matters.‚Äù\\n\\n# Your task:\\n(1) You must **make a plan** for this round, where your immediate goal is to handle the task of **crafting**.\\n(2) You may predict what will happen and think about the best strategy to win. \\n(3) You have your old plan for reference. REMEMBER, **you are planning**, so you may ask for information, but not able to make a proposal / make a decision or do a crafting. \\n(4) And in the output plan, you should use symbol **<current status>** to annotate the border between true game history and the plan / prediction. \\n\\n# Useable tools:\\npossible_recipes_from_hand - Get the list of possible craft recipes affordable by your hand resources.\\n\\n        Args:\\n            messages:dict = {\\\"username\\\": your username}\\nitem_info - Get crafting recipes related to `item_name`.\\n        The return is in format of a string.\\n        First line of return is the recipes which can output the item ({input: ingredients, output: results}),\\n        each item is given as `item_name:item_value` pair, where item_value is a fraction of form {n: number, d: number}\\n        where n s numerator and d represents denominator.\\n        Second line of the return is the recipes where item can be used as input.\\n\\n        Args:\\n            messages:str = \\\"item_name\\\"\\nrethink(messages: str) - Dummy Tool\\n\\nA tool which can buy you another round to rethink.\\nIt accepts any string for inupt and outputs empty string.\\n\\nArgs:\\nmessages = \\\"any string\\\"\\n\\n# Instructions\\n[Important Note 1] In this game, **the amount of the items are important**, you must take care of the exact amount of each item you need in the plan. You may plan by answering the following questions:\\n1. What is my target. What does each player have in hand?\\n2. What are possible ways to craft the target, based on items in all player's hands, how many do I need? Is it still possible for me to craft?\\n3. What must I trade from other players, trade with which item and how many.\\n4. What might other players' targets be? What might others think?\\n5. How to avoid other players' obtaining the target before me?\\n6. How would I use the items? Write the crafting plan step by step.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n# Output Format\\n**Your output should strictly follow the format below**, **you MUST use the tags to control the flow**:\\n - Thought: you should always think about what to do\\n - Action: the action you can take, should be one of [possible_recipes_from_hand, item_info, rethink].\\n - Action Input: the input to the action, according to the tool's arguments. \\n - Thought: I think I have a good plan.\\n - Final Output: the most reasonable plan you make for this game and the whole plan you make\\n\\n# Recent Observations & History(Turns Recordings):\\n\\nAttention!

Would you trade an iron ingot for them? Also, what are you planning to craft?\\n\\n\\nUnfortunately, gemini_competitive's proposal has been rejected.\\n\\n### Crafting Phase\\n\\n[Important Note 2] The game history above may be long. You should:\\n- Focus on the most recent player actions and state updates.\\n- Ignore repeated or irrelevant exchanges.\\n- Pay attention to any item changes, successful trades, and crafting results.\\n- Note that the entire observation is time-ordered: it starts from the beginning of the game and ends at the current turn.\\n## Special tips\\n1Ôºâ Tag Resolution:\\n- **Tags like `minecraft:fuel` or `minecraft:planks` are *not actual items*** ‚Äî they are *categories* used in recipes.\\n- You must **replace any tag** with a valid item from your own hand that belongs to that tag.  \\n    - For example:  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1` = `coal * 1.0` = `cherry_planks * 16/3`  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1/8` = `coal * 0.125` = `cherry_planks * 2/3`\\n- **Never submit a recipe with `\\\"minecraft:fuel\\\"` as an input**. Always substitute it with items like `\\\"coal\\\": 0.125` or `\\\"cherry_planks\\\": 0.667`.\\n- Similarly, if a recipe uses `#minecraft:planks`, and you hold `cherry_planks`, you may use it directly as input.\\n2Ôºâ Strict Recipe Matching:\\n- You must use **the exact input/output ratio** as defined in the recipe. For example, if crafting sticks requires:\\n  - `\\\"input\\\": \\\"#planks\\\": 2, \\\"output\\\": \\\"stick\\\": 4\\\"`, then don't use 1 plank and expecting 2 sticks.\\n- **Do not downscale or fraction the recipe arbitrarily.** Always follow integral crafting rules as listed in item info and recipe outputs.\\n\\n\\n# Old Plan:\\nHere is the plan you made last time, for your reference: \\nAgent stopped due to iteration limit or time limit.\\n\\nWhen you make a plan, focus on the items you already have, as well as **the items you are targeting**,to make a plan.Now, start making your plan for this turn!\\n\\n\",\"type\":\"StringPromptValue\"}",

  "msg": "{\"text\":\"You together with your team is playing a game called **tradeCraft**. Your team's username is **gemini_cooperative**.\\n\\n# Game introduction\\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# üèÜ **Winning Condition**\\n1.Focus on crafting your target item as efficiently as possible.\\n2.Support your opponent‚Äôs progress through information-sharing and fair trade.\\n\\n# üå± **Strategy Tips**\\n1. Prioritize trades that create mutual benefit, even at short-term cost to yourself. In this mode, winning requires that both sides progress.\\n2. Openly share insights about item chains, crafting routes, and inferred goals. If you notice the other side may be stuck, offer clues or relevant resources to assist them.\\n3. Transparency and goodwill are essential ‚Äî unlike in competitive play, where bluffing, misdirection, and information hoarding are common tactics, this mode thrives on honest cooperation and trust-building.\\n4. In many other games, teams may deceive, bait, or manipulate their opponents to gain an edge. But here, such tactics undermine collective success. Replace bluffing with clarity, replace probing for secrets with volunteering support.\\n5. Think of your team and the other as allies bound by shared fate: coordination, empathy, and shared planning are your strongest weapons.\\nü§ù ‚ÄúTo win alone is to lose together.

Would you trade an iron ingot for them? Also, what are you planning to craft?\\n\\n\\nUnfortunately, gemini_competitive's proposal has been rejected.\\n\\n### Crafting Phase\\n\\n[Important Note 2] The game history above may be long. You should:\\n- Focus on the most recent player actions and state updates.\\n- Ignore repeated or irrelevant exchanges.\\n- Pay attention to any item changes, successful trades, and crafting results.\\n- Note that the entire observation is time-ordered: it starts from the beginning of the game and ends at the current turn.\\n## Special tips\\n1Ôºâ Tag Resolution:\\n- **Tags like `minecraft:fuel` or `minecraft:planks` are *not actual items*** ‚Äî they are *categories* used in recipes.\\n- You must **replace any tag** with a valid item from your own hand that belongs to that tag.  \\n    - For example:  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1` = `coal * 1.0` = `cherry_planks * 16/3`  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1/8` = `coal * 0.125` = `cherry_planks * 2/3`\\n- **Never submit a recipe with `\\\"minecraft:fuel\\\"` as an input**. Always substitute it with items like `\\\"coal\\\": 0.125` or `\\\"cherry_planks\\\": 0.667`.\\n- Similarly, if a recipe uses `#minecraft:planks`, and you hold `cherry_planks`, you may use it directly as input.\\n2Ôºâ Strict Recipe Matching:\\n- You must use **the exact input/output ratio** as defined in the recipe. For example, if crafting sticks requires:\\n  - `\\\"input\\\": \\\"#planks\\\": 2, \\\"output\\\": \\\"stick\\\": 4\\\"`, then don't use 1 plank and expecting 2 sticks.\\n- **Do not downscale or fraction the recipe arbitrarily.** Always follow integral crafting rules as listed in item info and recipe outputs.\\n\\n\\n# Old Plan:\\nHere is the plan you made last time, for your reference: \\nAgent stopped due to iteration limit or time limit.\\n\\nWhen you make a plan, focus on the items you already have, as well as **the items you are targeting**,to make a plan.Now, start making your plan for this turn!\\nParsing LLM output produced both a final answer and a parse-able action:: Thought: My target is minecraft:iron_axe. I have 2 iron ingots and 1 raw iron. The opponent has 2 raw iron and 2 raw copper. I offered to trade 1 iron ingot for 2 raw iron, but the offer was rejected.

You should:\\n- Focus on the most recent player actions and state updates.\\n- Ignore repeated or irrelevant exchanges.\\n- Pay attention to any item changes, successful trades, and crafting results.\\n- Note that the entire observation is time-ordered: it starts from the beginning of the game and ends at the current turn.\\n## Special tips\\n1Ôºâ Tag Resolution:\\n- **Tags like `minecraft:fuel` or `minecraft:planks` are *not actual items*** ‚Äî they are *categories* used in recipes.\\n- You must **replace any tag** with a valid item from your own hand that belongs to that tag.  \\n    - For example:  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1` = `coal * 1.0` = `cherry_planks * 16/3`  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1/8` = `coal * 0.125` = `cherry_planks * 2/3`\\n- **Never submit a recipe with `\\\"minecraft:fuel\\\"` as an input**. Always substitute it with items like `\\\"coal\\\": 0.125` or `\\\"cherry_planks\\\": 0.667`.\\n- Similarly, if a recipe uses `#minecraft:planks`, and you hold `cherry_planks`, you may use it directly as input.\\n2Ôºâ Strict Recipe Matching:\\n- You must use **the exact input/output ratio** as defined in the recipe. For example, if crafting sticks requires:\\n  - `\\\"input\\\": \\\"#planks\\\": 2, \\\"output\\\": \\\"stick\\\": 4\\\"`, then don't use 1 plank and expecting 2 sticks.\\n- **Do not downscale or fraction the recipe arbitrarily.** Always follow integral crafting rules as listed in item info and recipe outputs.\\n\\n\\n# Old Plan:\\nHere is the plan you made last time, for your reference: \\nAgent stopped due to iteration limit or time limit.\\n\\nWhen you make a plan, focus on the items you already have, as well as **the items you are targeting**,to make a plan.Now, start making your plan for this turn!\\nParsing LLM output produced both a final answer and a parse-able action:: Thought: My target is minecraft:iron_axe.

  "msg": "{\"text\":\"You together with your team is playing a game called **tradeCraft**. Your team's username is **gemini_cooperative**.\\n\\n# Game introduction\\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# üèÜ **Winning Condition**\\n1.Focus on crafting your target item as efficiently as possible.\\n2.Support your opponent‚Äôs progress through information-sharing and fair trade.\\n\\n# üå± **Strategy Tips**\\n1. Prioritize trades that create mutual benefit, even at short-term cost to yourself. In this mode, winning requires that both sides progress.\\n2. Openly share insights about item chains, crafting routes, and inferred goals. If you notice the other side may be stuck, offer clues or relevant resources to assist them.\\n3. Transparency and goodwill are essential ‚Äî unlike in competitive play, where bluffing, misdirection, and information hoarding are common tactics, this mode thrives on honest cooperation and trust-building.\\n4. In many other games, teams may deceive, bait, or manipulate their opponents to gain an edge. But here, such tactics undermine collective success. Replace bluffing with clarity, replace probing for secrets with volunteering support.\\n5. Think of your team and the other as allies bound by shared fate: coordination, empathy, and shared planning are your strongest weapons.\\nü§ù ‚ÄúTo win alone is to lose together.

You should:\\n- Focus on the most recent player actions and state updates.\\n- Ignore repeated or irrelevant exchanges.\\n- Pay attention to any item changes, successful trades, and crafting results.\\n- Note that the entire observation is time-ordered: it starts from the beginning of the game and ends at the current turn.\\n## Special tips\\n1Ôºâ Tag Resolution:\\n- **Tags like `minecraft:fuel` or `minecraft:planks` are *not actual items*** ‚Äî they are *categories* used in recipes.\\n- You must **replace any tag** with a valid item from your own hand that belongs to that tag.  \\n    - For example:  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1` = `coal * 1.0` = `cherry_planks * 16/3`  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1/8` = `coal * 0.125` = `cherry_planks * 2/3`\\n- **Never submit a recipe with `\\\"minecraft:fuel\\\"` as an input**. Always substitute it with items like `\\\"coal\\\": 0.125` or `\\\"cherry_planks\\\": 0.667`.\\n- Similarly, if a recipe uses `#minecraft:planks`, and you hold `cherry_planks`, you may use it directly as input.\\n2Ôºâ Strict Recipe Matching:\\n- You must use **the exact input/output ratio** as defined in the recipe. For example, if crafting sticks requires:\\n  - `\\\"input\\\": \\\"#planks\\\": 2, \\\"output\\\": \\\"stick\\\": 4\\\"`, then don't use 1 plank and expecting 2 sticks.\\n- **Do not downscale or fraction the recipe arbitrarily.** Always follow integral crafting rules as listed in item info and recipe outputs.\\n\\n\\n# Old Plan:\\nHere is the plan you made last time, for your reference: \\nAgent stopped due to iteration limit or time limit.\\n\\nWhen you make a plan, focus on the items you already have, as well as **the items you are targeting**,to make a plan.Now, start making your plan for this turn!\\nParsing LLM output produced both a final answer and a parse-able action:: Thought: My target is minecraft:iron_axe.

  "msg": "{\"text\":\"You together with your team is playing a game called **tradeCraft**. Your team's username is **gemini_cooperative**.\\n\\n# Game introduction\\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# üèÜ **Winning Condition**\\n1.Focus on crafting your target item as efficiently as possible.\\n2.Support your opponent‚Äôs progress through information-sharing and fair trade.\\n\\n# üå± **Strategy Tips**\\n1. Prioritize trades that create mutual benefit, even at short-term cost to yourself. In this mode, winning requires that both sides progress.\\n2. Openly share insights about item chains, crafting routes, and inferred goals. If you notice the other side may be stuck, offer clues or relevant resources to assist them.\\n3. Transparency and goodwill are essential ‚Äî unlike in competitive play, where bluffing, misdirection, and information hoarding are common tactics, this mode thrives on honest cooperation and trust-building.\\n4. In many other games, teams may deceive, bait, or manipulate their opponents to gain an edge. But here, such tactics undermine collective success. Replace bluffing with clarity, replace probing for secrets with volunteering support.\\n5. Think of your team and the other as allies bound by shared fate: coordination, empathy, and shared planning are your strongest weapons.\\nü§ù ‚ÄúTo win alone is to lose together. To win together is the only victory that matters.‚Äù\\n\\n# Your task:\\n(1) You must **make a plan** for this round, where your immediate goal is to handle the task of **crafting**.\\n(2) You may predict what will happen and think about the best strategy to win. \\n(3) You have your old plan for reference. REMEMBER, **you are planning**, so you may ask for information, but not able to make a proposal / make a decision or do a crafting. \\n(4) And in the output plan, you should use symbol **<current status>** to annotate the border between true game history and the plan / prediction. \\n\\n# Useable tools:\\npossible_recipes_from_hand - Get the list of possible craft recipes affordable by your hand resources.\\n\\n        Args:\\n            messages:dict = {\\\"username\\\": your username}\\nitem_info - Get crafting recipes related to `item_name`.\\n        The return is in format of a string.\\n        First line of return is the recipes which can output the item ({input: ingredients, output: results}),\\n        each item is given as `item_name:item_value` pair, where item_value is a fraction of form {n: number, d: number}\\n        where n s numerator and d represents denominator.\\n        Second line of the return is the recipes where item can be used as input.\\n\\n        Args:\\n            messages:str = \\\"item_name\\\"\\nrethink(messages: str) - Dummy Tool\\n\\nA tool which can buy you another round to rethink.\\nIt accepts any string for inupt and outputs empty string.\\n\\nArgs:\\nmessages = \\\"any string\\\"\\n\\n# Instructions\\n[Important Note 1] In this game, **the amount of the items are important**, you must take care of the exact amount of each item you need in the plan. You may plan by answering the following questions:\\n1. What is my target. What does each player have in hand?\\n2. What are possible ways to craft the target, based on items in all player's hands, how many do I need? Is it still possible for me to craft?\\n3. What must I trade from other players, trade with which item and how many.\\n4. What might other players' targets be? What might others think?\\n5. How to avoid other players' obtaining the target before me?\\n6. How would I use the items?

Would you trade an iron ingot for them? Also, what are you planning to craft?\\n\\n\\nUnfortunately, gemini_competitive's proposal has been rejected.\\n\\n### Crafting Phase\\n\\n[Important Note 2] The game history above may be long. You should:\\n- Focus on the most recent player actions and state updates.\\n- Ignore repeated or irrelevant exchanges.\\n- Pay attention to any item changes, successful trades, and crafting results.\\n- Note that the entire observation is time-ordered: it starts from the beginning of the game and ends at the current turn.\\n## Special tips\\n1Ôºâ Tag Resolution:\\n- **Tags like `minecraft:fuel` or `minecraft:planks` are *not actual items*** ‚Äî they are *categories* used in recipes.\\n- You must **replace any tag** with a valid item from your own hand that belongs to that tag.  \\n    - For example:  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1` = `coal * 1.0` = `cherry_planks * 16/3`  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1/8` = `coal * 0.125` = `cherry_planks * 2/3`\\n- **Never submit a recipe with `\\\"minecraft:fuel\\\"` as an input**. Always substitute it with items like `\\\"coal\\\": 0.125` or `\\\"cherry_planks\\\": 0.667`.\\n- Similarly, if a recipe uses `#minecraft:planks`, and you hold `cherry_planks`, you may use it directly as input.\\n2Ôºâ Strict Recipe Matching:\\n- You must use **the exact input/output ratio** as defined in the recipe. For example, if crafting sticks requires:\\n  - `\\\"input\\\": \\\"#planks\\\": 2, \\\"output\\\": \\\"stick\\\": 4\\\"`, then don't use 1 plank and expecting 2 sticks.\\n- **Do not downscale or fraction the recipe arbitrarily.** Always follow integral crafting rules as listed in item info and recipe outputs.\\n\\n\\n# Old Plan:\\nHere is the plan you made last time, for your reference: \\nAgent stopped due to iteration limit or time limit.\\n\\nWhen you make a plan, focus on the items you already have, as well as **the items you are targeting**,to make a plan.Now, start making your plan for this turn!\\nParsing LLM output produced both a final answer and a parse-able action:: Thought: My target is minecraft:iron_axe.

  "msg": "{\"text\":\"# Game Setting.\\nYou and your teamates are playing a game called **tradeCraft**, here is the game introduction.  \\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# üèÜ **Winning Condition**\\n1.Focus on crafting your target item as efficiently as possible.\\n2.Support your opponent‚Äôs progress through information-sharing and fair trade.\\n\\n# üå± **Strategy Tips**\\n1. Prioritize trades that create mutual benefit, even at short-term cost to yourself. In this mode, winning requires that both sides progress.\\n2. Openly share insights about item chains, crafting routes, and inferred goals. If you notice the other side may be stuck, offer clues or relevant resources to assist them.\\n3. Transparency and goodwill are essential ‚Äî unlike in competitive play, where bluffing, misdirection, and information hoarding are common tactics, this mode thrives on honest cooperation and trust-building.\\n4. In many other games, teams may deceive, bait, or manipulate their opponents to gain an edge. But here, such tactics undermine collective success. Replace bluffing with clarity, replace probing for secrets with volunteering support.\\n5.

  "msg": "{\"text\":\"# Game Setting.\\nYou and your teamates are playing a game called **tradeCraft**, here is the game introduction.  \\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# üèÜ **Winning Condition**\\n1.Focus on crafting your target item as efficiently as possible.\\n2.Support your opponent‚Äôs progress through information-sharing and fair trade.\\n\\n# üå± **Strategy Tips**\\n1. Prioritize trades that create mutual benefit, even at short-term cost to yourself. In this mode, winning requires that both sides progress.\\n2. Openly share insights about item chains, crafting routes, and inferred goals. If you notice the other side may be stuck, offer clues or relevant resources to assist them.\\n3. Transparency and goodwill are essential ‚Äî unlike in competitive play, where bluffing, misdirection, and information hoarding are common tactics, this mode thrives on honest cooperation and trust-building.\\n4. In many other games, teams may deceive, bait, or manipulate their opponents to gain an edge. But here, such tactics undermine collective success. Replace bluffing with clarity, replace probing for secrets with volunteering support.\\n5. Think of your team and the other as allies bound by shared fate: coordination, empathy, and shared planning are your strongest weapons.\\nü§ù ‚ÄúTo win alone is to lose together.

  "msg": "{\"text\":\"# Game Setting.\\nYou and your teamates are playing a game called **tradeCraft**, here is the game introduction.  \\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# üèÜ **Winning Condition**\\n1.Focus on crafting your target item as efficiently as possible.\\n2.Support your opponent‚Äôs progress through information-sharing and fair trade.\\n\\n# üå± **Strategy Tips**\\n1. Prioritize trades that create mutual benefit, even at short-term cost to yourself. In this mode, winning requires that both sides progress.\\n2. Openly share insights about item chains, crafting routes, and inferred goals. If you notice the other side may be stuck, offer clues or relevant resources to assist them.\\n3. Transparency and goodwill are essential ‚Äî unlike in competitive play, where bluffing, misdirection, and information hoarding are common tactics, this mode thrives on honest cooperation and trust-building.\\n4. In many other games, teams may deceive, bait, or manipulate their opponents to gain an edge. But here, such tactics undermine collective success. Replace bluffing with clarity, replace probing for secrets with volunteering support.\\n5. Think of your team and the other as allies bound by shared fate: coordination, empathy, and shared planning are your strongest weapons.\\nü§ù ‚ÄúTo win alone is to lose together. To win together is the only victory that matters.‚Äù\\n\\nYour team's username is **gemini_cooperative**.\\nYour are the **crafter** in your team: who should think what your team need, check possible recipes and carry out craft. \\nYou should stick to your **wining condition** and **strategy tips**\\n\\nNow its your turn to act, you must manage to craft some target items. Your team's username name is **gemini_cooperative**.\\nIn this game, crafting follows strictly rule set of *MineCraft*, all ingredients are required, but all related infrastructures are given.\\n\\n# Instructions\\nYou may act following the next steps: \\nstep 1. identify what items should be crafted for your final **winning condition** in your current turn according to history and current state.  \\nstep 2. from the **current state** section, extract YOUR latest hand items.  \\nstep 3. make a detailed plan about what to craft step by step, including in each step what recipes must be used and specify input / output items with their amount. Make sure you follow the guidance of **Special Tips**. You may use tools to help you know what could be crafted and the crafting properties of each item.  \\nstep 4. follow your plan step by step, using correct recipes and assign exact amount of the input / output items. While crafting each item, use tool \\\"craft_recipe_check\\\" to check for recipe correctedness, you may repeatedly checking until it is correct, then use tool \\\"craft_recipe_apply\\\" to apply it.  \\nstep 5. if target is done or mistakes happens, try to run step 3 and step 4, if a repeat does not work, return with \\\"craft_done\\\" and an error message, try to find another strategy to win the game.\\n\\nUse *Final Output:* to tell that you are done with all crafts in this turn.\\n\\n\\n# Strategic Reminder  \\nAt **every step**, especially when writing a *Thought* or deciding what to craft, **always recall your team's winning condition and strategy tips**.  \\nYour crafting plan should **serve the exact goals defined in your current game mode**: whether it is cooperation, competition, or pure self-optimization.  \\nLet your **reasoning, material prioritization, and crafting sequence** all align with your winning logic.\\n\\n## Special tips\\n1Ôºâ Tag Resolution:\\n- **Tags like `minecraft:fuel` or `minecraft:planks` are *not actual items*** ‚Äî they are *categories* used in recipes.\\n- You must **replace any tag** with a valid item from your own hand that belongs to that tag.  \\n    - For example:  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1` = `coal * 1.0` = `cherry_planks * 16/3`  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1/8` = `coal * 0.125` = `cherry_planks * 2/3`\\n- **Never submit a recipe with `\\\"minecraft:fuel\\\"` as an input**. Always substitute it with items like `\\\"coal\\\": 0.125` or `\\\"cherry_planks\\\": 0.667`.\\n- Similarly, if a recipe uses `#minecraft:planks`, and you hold `cherry_planks`, you may use it directly as input.\\n\\n2Ôºâ Craft Feasibility Check:\\n- Before you use `Action: craft_recipe_check`, you must **verify that your current hand has all required ingredients in sufficient quantities**.\\n- Recipes that are correct in logic but **unfeasible with your current inventory** will be rejected.\\n- To avoid this, always extract your current hand from the latest game log and/or use `possible_recipes_from_hand` to ensure your plan is executable at this moment.\\n\\n3Ôºâ Strict Recipe Matching:\\n- You must use **the exact input/output ratio** as defined in the recipe. For example, if crafting sticks requires:\\n  - `\\\"input\\\": \\\"#planks\\\": 2, \\\"output\\\": \\\"stick\\\": 4\\\"`, then don't use 1 plank and expecting 2 sticks.\\n- **Do not downscale or fraction the recipe arbitrarily.** Always follow integral crafting rules as listed in item info and recipe outputs.\\n\\n\\n# Game log:\\nHere is major events happened in the game:\\n\\nAttention!

  "msg": "{\"text\":\"# Game Setting.\\nYou and your teamates are playing a game called **tradeCraft**, here is the game introduction.  \\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# üèÜ **Winning Condition**\\n1.Focus on crafting your target item as efficiently as possible.\\n2.Support your opponent‚Äôs progress through information-sharing and fair trade.\\n\\n# üå± **Strategy Tips**\\n1. Prioritize trades that create mutual benefit, even at short-term cost to yourself. In this mode, winning requires that both sides progress.\\n2. Openly share insights about item chains, crafting routes, and inferred goals. If you notice the other side may be stuck, offer clues or relevant resources to assist them.\\n3. Transparency and goodwill are essential ‚Äî unlike in competitive play, where bluffing, misdirection, and information hoarding are common tactics, this mode thrives on honest cooperation and trust-building.\\n4. In many other games, teams may deceive, bait, or manipulate their opponents to gain an edge. But here, such tactics undermine collective success. Replace bluffing with clarity, replace probing for secrets with volunteering support.\\n5. Think of your team and the other as allies bound by shared fate: coordination, empathy, and shared planning are your strongest weapons.\\nü§ù ‚ÄúTo win alone is to lose together. To win together is the only victory that matters.‚Äù\\n\\nYour team's username is **gemini_cooperative**.\\nYour are the **crafter** in your team: who should think what your team need, check possible recipes and carry out craft. \\nYou should stick to your **wining condition** and **strategy tips**\\n\\nNow its your turn to act, you must manage to craft some target items. Your team's username name is **gemini_cooperative**.\\nIn this game, crafting follows strictly rule set of *MineCraft*, all ingredients are required, but all related infrastructures are given.\\n\\n# Instructions\\nYou may act following the next steps: \\nstep 1. identify what items should be crafted for your final **winning condition** in your current turn according to history and current state.  \\nstep 2. from the **current state** section, extract YOUR latest hand items.  \\nstep 3. make a detailed plan about what to craft step by step, including in each step what recipes must be used and specify input / output items with their amount. Make sure you follow the guidance of **Special Tips**. You may use tools to help you know what could be crafted and the crafting properties of each item.  \\nstep 4. follow your plan step by step, using correct recipes and assign exact amount of the input / output items. While crafting each item, use tool \\\"craft_recipe_check\\\" to check for recipe correctedness, you may repeatedly checking until it is correct, then use tool \\\"craft_recipe_apply\\\" to apply it.  \\nstep 5. if target is done or mistakes happens, try to run step 3 and step 4, if a repeat does not work, return with \\\"craft_done\\\" and an error message, try to find another strategy to win the game.\\n\\nUse *Final Output:* to tell that you are done with all crafts in this turn.\\n\\n\\n# Strategic Reminder  \\nAt **every step**, especially when writing a *Thought* or deciding what to craft, **always recall your team's winning condition and strategy tips**.  \\nYour crafting plan should **serve the exact goals defined in your current game mode**: whether it is cooperation, competition, or pure self-optimization.  \\nLet your **reasoning, material prioritization, and crafting sequence** all align with your winning logic.\\n\\n## Special tips\\n1Ôºâ Tag Resolution:\\n- **Tags like `minecraft:fuel` or `minecraft:planks` are *not actual items*** ‚Äî they are *categories* used in recipes.\\n- You must **replace any tag** with a valid item from your own hand that belongs to that tag.  \\n    - For example:  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1` = `coal * 1.0` = `cherry_planks * 16/3`  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1/8` = `coal * 0.125` = `cherry_planks * 2/3`\\n- **Never submit a recipe with `\\\"minecraft:fuel\\\"` as an input**. Always substitute it with items like `\\\"coal\\\": 0.125` or `\\\"cherry_planks\\\": 0.667`.\\n- Similarly, if a recipe uses `#minecraft:planks`, and you hold `cherry_planks`, you may use it directly as input.\\n\\n2Ôºâ Craft Feasibility Check:\\n- Before you use `Action: craft_recipe_check`, you must **verify that your current hand has all required ingredients in sufficient quantities**.\\n- Recipes that are correct in logic but **unfeasible with your current inventory** will be rejected.\\n- To avoid this, always extract your current hand from the latest game log and/or use `possible_recipes_from_hand` to ensure your plan is executable at this moment.\\n\\n3Ôºâ Strict Recipe Matching:\\n- You must use **the exact input/output ratio** as defined in the recipe. For example, if crafting sticks requires:\\n  - `\\\"input\\\": \\\"#planks\\\": 2, \\\"output\\\": \\\"stick\\\": 4\\\"`, then don't use 1 plank and expecting 2 sticks.\\n- **Do not downscale or fraction the recipe arbitrarily.** Always follow integral crafting rules as listed in item info and recipe outputs.\\n\\n\\n# Game log:\\nHere is major events happened in the game:\\n\\nAttention!

  "msg": "{\"text\":\"# Game Setting.\\nYou and your teamates are playing a game called **tradeCraft**, here is the game introduction.  \\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# üèÜ **Winning Condition**\\n1.Focus on crafting your target item as efficiently as possible.\\n2.Support your opponent‚Äôs progress through information-sharing and fair trade.\\n\\n# üå± **Strategy Tips**\\n1. Prioritize trades that create mutual benefit, even at short-term cost to yourself. In this mode, winning requires that both sides progress.\\n2. Openly share insights about item chains, crafting routes, and inferred goals. If you notice the other side may be stuck, offer clues or relevant resources to assist them.\\n3. Transparency and goodwill are essential ‚Äî unlike in competitive play, where bluffing, misdirection, and information hoarding are common tactics, this mode thrives on honest cooperation and trust-building.\\n4. In many other games, teams may deceive, bait, or manipulate their opponents to gain an edge. But here, such tactics undermine collective success. Replace bluffing with clarity, replace probing for secrets with volunteering support.\\n5. Think of your team and the other as allies bound by shared fate: coordination, empathy, and shared planning are your strongest weapons.\\nü§ù ‚ÄúTo win alone is to lose together. To win together is the only victory that matters.‚Äù\\n\\nYour team's username is **gemini_cooperative**.\\nYour are the **crafter** in your team: who should think what your team need, check possible recipes and carry out craft. \\nYou should stick to your **wining condition** and **strategy tips**\\n\\nNow its your turn to act, you must manage to craft some target items. Your team's username name is **gemini_cooperative**.\\nIn this game, crafting follows strictly rule set of *MineCraft*, all ingredients are required, but all related infrastructures are given.\\n\\n# Instructions\\nYou may act following the next steps: \\nstep 1. identify what items should be crafted for your final **winning condition** in your current turn according to history and current state.  \\nstep 2. from the **current state** section, extract YOUR latest hand items.  \\nstep 3. make a detailed plan about what to craft step by step, including in each step what recipes must be used and specify input / output items with their amount. Make sure you follow the guidance of **Special Tips**. You may use tools to help you know what could be crafted and the crafting properties of each item.  \\nstep 4. follow your plan step by step, using correct recipes and assign exact amount of the input / output items. While crafting each item, use tool \\\"craft_recipe_check\\\" to check for recipe correctedness, you may repeatedly checking until it is correct, then use tool \\\"craft_recipe_apply\\\" to apply it.  \\nstep 5. if target is done or mistakes happens, try to run step 3 and step 4, if a repeat does not work, return with \\\"craft_done\\\" and an error message, try to find another strategy to win the game.\\n\\nUse *Final Output:* to tell that you are done with all crafts in this turn.\\n\\n\\n# Strategic Reminder  \\nAt **every step**, especially when writing a *Thought* or deciding what to craft, **always recall your team's winning condition and strategy tips**.  \\nYour crafting plan should **serve the exact goals defined in your current game mode**: whether it is cooperation, competition, or pure self-optimization.  \\nLet your **reasoning, material prioritization, and crafting sequence** all align with your winning logic.\\n\\n## Special tips\\n1Ôºâ Tag Resolution:\\n- **Tags like `minecraft:fuel` or `minecraft:planks` are *not actual items*** ‚Äî they are *categories* used in recipes.\\n- You must **replace any tag** with a valid item from your own hand that belongs to that tag.  \\n    - For example:  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1` = `coal * 1.0` = `cherry_planks * 16/3`  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1/8` = `coal * 0.125` = `cherry_planks * 2/3`\\n- **Never submit a recipe with `\\\"minecraft:fuel\\\"` as an input**. Always substitute it with items like `\\\"coal\\\": 0.125` or `\\\"cherry_planks\\\": 0.667`.\\n- Similarly, if a recipe uses `#minecraft:planks`, and you hold `cherry_planks`, you may use it directly as input.\\n\\n2Ôºâ Craft Feasibility Check:\\n- Before you use `Action: craft_recipe_check`, you must **verify that your current hand has all required ingredients in sufficient quantities**.\\n- Recipes that are correct in logic but **unfeasible with your current inventory** will be rejected.\\n- To avoid this, always extract your current hand from the latest game log and/or use `possible_recipes_from_hand` to ensure your plan is executable at this moment.\\n\\n3Ôºâ Strict Recipe Matching:\\n- You must use **the exact input/output ratio** as defined in the recipe. For example, if crafting sticks requires:\\n  - `\\\"input\\\": \\\"#planks\\\": 2, \\\"output\\\": \\\"stick\\\": 4\\\"`, then don't use 1 plank and expecting 2 sticks.\\n- **Do not downscale or fraction the recipe arbitrarily.** Always follow integral crafting rules as listed in item info and recipe outputs.\\n\\n\\n# Game log:\\nHere is major events happened in the game:\\n\\nAttention!

  "msg": "{\"text\":\"# Game Setting.\\nYou and your teamates are playing a game called **tradeCraft**, here is the game introduction.  \\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# üèÜ **Winning Condition**\\n1.Focus on crafting your target item as efficiently as possible.\\n2.Support your opponent‚Äôs progress through information-sharing and fair trade.\\n\\n# üå± **Strategy Tips**\\n1. Prioritize trades that create mutual benefit, even at short-term cost to yourself. In this mode, winning requires that both sides progress.\\n2. Openly share insights about item chains, crafting routes, and inferred goals. If you notice the other side may be stuck, offer clues or relevant resources to assist them.\\n3. Transparency and goodwill are essential ‚Äî unlike in competitive play, where bluffing, misdirection, and information hoarding are common tactics, this mode thrives on honest cooperation and trust-building.\\n4. In many other games, teams may deceive, bait, or manipulate their opponents to gain an edge. But here, such tactics undermine collective success. Replace bluffing with clarity, replace probing for secrets with volunteering support.\\n5. Think of your team and the other as allies bound by shared fate: coordination, empathy, and shared planning are your strongest weapons.\\nü§ù ‚ÄúTo win alone is to lose together. To win together is the only victory that matters.‚Äù\\n\\nYour team's username is **gemini_cooperative**.\\nYour are the **crafter** in your team: who should think what your team need, check possible recipes and carry out craft. \\nYou should stick to your **wining condition** and **strategy tips**\\n\\nNow its your turn to act, you must manage to craft some target items. Your team's username name is **gemini_cooperative**.\\nIn this game, crafting follows strictly rule set of *MineCraft*, all ingredients are required, but all related infrastructures are given.\\n\\n# Instructions\\nYou may act following the next steps: \\nstep 1. identify what items should be crafted for your final **winning condition** in your current turn according to history and current state.  \\nstep 2. from the **current state** section, extract YOUR latest hand items.  \\nstep 3. make a detailed plan about what to craft step by step, including in each step what recipes must be used and specify input / output items with their amount. Make sure you follow the guidance of **Special Tips**. You may use tools to help you know what could be crafted and the crafting properties of each item.  \\nstep 4. follow your plan step by step, using correct recipes and assign exact amount of the input / output items. While crafting each item, use tool \\\"craft_recipe_check\\\" to check for recipe correctedness, you may repeatedly checking until it is correct, then use tool \\\"craft_recipe_apply\\\" to apply it.  \\nstep 5. if target is done or mistakes happens, try to run step 3 and step 4, if a repeat does not work, return with \\\"craft_done\\\" and an error message, try to find another strategy to win the game.\\n\\nUse *Final Output:* to tell that you are done with all crafts in this turn.\\n\\n\\n# Strategic Reminder  \\nAt **every step**, especially when writing a *Thought* or deciding what to craft, **always recall your team's winning condition and strategy tips**.  \\nYour crafting plan should **serve the exact goals defined in your current game mode**: whether it is cooperation, competition, or pure self-optimization.  \\nLet your **reasoning, material prioritization, and crafting sequence** all align with your winning logic.\\n\\n## Special tips\\n1Ôºâ Tag Resolution:\\n- **Tags like `minecraft:fuel` or `minecraft:planks` are *not actual items*** ‚Äî they are *categories* used in recipes.\\n- You must **replace any tag** with a valid item from your own hand that belongs to that tag.  \\n    - For example:  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1` = `coal * 1.0` = `cherry_planks * 16/3`  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1/8` = `coal * 0.125` = `cherry_planks * 2/3`\\n- **Never submit a recipe with `\\\"minecraft:fuel\\\"` as an input**. Always substitute it with items like `\\\"coal\\\": 0.125` or `\\\"cherry_planks\\\": 0.667`.\\n- Similarly, if a recipe uses `#minecraft:planks`, and you hold `cherry_planks`, you may use it directly as input.\\n\\n2Ôºâ Craft Feasibility Check:\\n- Before you use `Action: craft_recipe_check`, you must **verify that your current hand has all required ingredients in sufficient quantities**.\\n- Recipes that are correct in logic but **unfeasible with your current inventory** will be rejected.\\n- To avoid this, always extract your current hand from the latest game log and/or use `possible_recipes_from_hand` to ensure your plan is executable at this moment.\\n\\n3Ôºâ Strict Recipe Matching:\\n- You must use **the exact input/output ratio** as defined in the recipe. For example, if crafting sticks requires:\\n  - `\\\"input\\\": \\\"#planks\\\": 2, \\\"output\\\": \\\"stick\\\": 4\\\"`, then don't use 1 plank and expecting 2 sticks.\\n- **Do not downscale or fraction the recipe arbitrarily.** Always follow integral crafting rules as listed in item info and recipe outputs.\\n\\n\\n# Game log:\\nHere is major events happened in the game:\\n\\nAttention!

  "msg": "{\"text\":\"# Game Setting.\\nYou and your teamates are playing a game called **tradeCraft**, here is the game introduction.  \\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# üèÜ **Winning Condition**\\n1.Focus on crafting your target item as efficiently as possible.\\n2.Support your opponent‚Äôs progress through information-sharing and fair trade.\\n\\n# üå± **Strategy Tips**\\n1. Prioritize trades that create mutual benefit, even at short-term cost to yourself. In this mode, winning requires that both sides progress.\\n2. Openly share insights about item chains, crafting routes, and inferred goals. If you notice the other side may be stuck, offer clues or relevant resources to assist them.\\n3. Transparency and goodwill are essential ‚Äî unlike in competitive play, where bluffing, misdirection, and information hoarding are common tactics, this mode thrives on honest cooperation and trust-building.\\n4. In many other games, teams may deceive, bait, or manipulate their opponents to gain an edge. But here, such tactics undermine collective success. Replace bluffing with clarity, replace probing for secrets with volunteering support.\\n5. Think of your team and the other as allies bound by shared fate: coordination, empathy, and shared planning are your strongest weapons.\\nü§ù ‚ÄúTo win alone is to lose together. To win together is the only victory that matters.‚Äù\\n\\nYour teams's username is **gemini_cooperative**.\\nYour are the **proposer** in your team: who would start a proposal at the beginning of each turn. \\nYou should stick to your **wining condition** and **strategy tips**\\n\\n# The task:\\nYou should make a proper proposal.\\nA proposal is made up of 4 parts:\\n- another playe to trade with,\\n- what you want to **offer** to the other player, format: `{item:amount}`,\\n- what you want to **request** to the other plater, format: `{item:amount}`,\\n- a text-based message you want to send to player, trying to persuade her / him to accept this proposal.\\n*This message should reflect your team's winning strategy.*\\n*Always align your entire proposal ‚Äî including player choice, offer/request items, and message tone ‚Äî with your team‚Äôs **winning condition** and **strategy tips**.*\\n\\nUse *Final Output:* to tell what you want to submit as your proposal, write in in JSON format.\\n\\n# Important Tips\\nplayer ID Validity:\\n- When filling in the `\\\"player\\\"` field of your proposal, **you must use the correct and valid opponent ID**.\\n- In this game, the only valid trading player for you is: **gemini_competitive**.\\n- Do not use an incorrect or non-existent player ID (e.g., `\\\"agent_1\\\"`) will cause your proposal to be rejected.\\nMake sure to **double-check** the `\\\"player\\\"` field in your final output.\\n\\n# Useable Tools\\nWhile doing you job you have the following tools:\\nitem_info - Get crafting recipes related to `item_name`.\\n        The return is in format of a string.\\n        First line of return is the recipes which can output the item ({input: ingredients, output: results}),\\n        each item is given as `item_name:item_value` pair, where item_value is a fraction of form {n: number, d: number}\\n        where n s numerator and d represents denominator.\\n        Second line of the return is the recipes where item can be used as input.\\n\\n        Args:\\n            messages:str = \\\"item_name\\\"\\nrethink(messages: str) - Dummy Tool\\n\\nA tool which can buy you another round to rethink.\\nIt accepts any string for inupt and outputs empty string.\\n\\nArgs:\\nmessages = \\\"any string\\\"\\n\\n\\n# Before you act:\\nAt every step, especially when writing a Thought or taking an Action, **recall your winning strategy** ‚Äî your behavior should serve that strategy.\\n\\n# Game log:\\nHere is major events happened in the game:\\nThe proposal from Player ***gemini_cooperative*** has been sent successfully.\\n\\n### Decision Phase\\n\\n    [gemini_competitive] replied to the proposal from [you]:\\n    I'm not interested in this trade.
