### About *tradeCraft*

The game *tradeCraft* is a multiplayer, turn-based strategy game. In the game
there are several players, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style
which is visible to all players, and has their own **secret** target item to obtain.
In **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two players in any
ratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be
crafted from items in hand by each player following strictly the recipes of
MineCraft.

#### Procedure
The game is turn-based. The player take turns to play as proposer.
A turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:
1. Proposing Phase: Proposer makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning
  - which player (**self**) is proposing,
  - which player (**partner**) to trade with,
  - the set of items **offer** to the partner,
  - the set of items **request** from the partner,
  - a *text message* sent to the partner.
   Then the proposal is sent to the partner.
2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal, the **partner** must decide to accept it or
   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.
   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is
   shown to everyone, otherwise, only `proposer's proposal is rejected` can
   be seen by others.
3. Crafting Phase: All players craft items in the following procedure:
  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\{"input":\{"item":amount\}, "output":\{"item":amount\}\}`,
    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is
    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use
    fractions!) and player's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.
    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing
    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using
    furnace.
  - If the recipe is checked valid, player can **apply** the recipe. The player
    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which
    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the
    player cannot apply it, new check is required.
  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), player can
    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.
    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.

  The turn is not finished until **all players** done with crafting.
  The results of each player's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.
  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message
  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.

#### Goal
In the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. The
goal is to use the items in hand, together with the items traded from others,
to craft the target item. System checks each player's hand after all players
finish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After
certain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.

#### Scoring
If only one player holds target item at the end of game, he is assigned 3 points.
If more than one player get target item, each receives 1 point. Other players
does not get any point.
