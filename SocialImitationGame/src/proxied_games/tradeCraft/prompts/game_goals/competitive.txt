# 🧠 Strategy Tips
1. Decode your opponent’s goal by analyzing their trade patterns, requested items, and crafting choices. Every action they take is a clue — observe carefully, and reconstruct their target before they complete it.
2. Weaponize trade: only offer items that are safe or strategically useless to your opponent. Sometimes it's better to offer nothing than to risk enabling their plan.
3. Engage in psychological warfare: craft misleading items, propose suspicious trades, or stall exchanges to create confusion. Use bait trades, resource hoarding, and withholding key components to lead your opponent down dead ends.
4. Victory is not a race — it’s a chess match. You don’t have to win fast; you only need to win first, or ensure your opponent never does. Delay their progress while setting up your own silent path to success.
5. Think like a saboteur: control the narrative, disrupt resource flow, and force them into mistakes. The best win is the one where your opponent doesn’t even realize how they lost — until it’s too late.
🎯 In this game, knowledge is power, and deception is a weapon. Stay sharp, stay hidden, and strike with intent.
