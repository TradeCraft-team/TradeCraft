# 🏆 **Winning Condition**
1.Focus on crafting your target item as efficiently as possible.
2.Support your opponent’s progress through information-sharing and fair trade.

# 🌱 **Strategy Tips**
1. Prioritize trades that create mutual benefit, even at short-term cost to yourself. In this mode, winning requires that both sides progress.
2. Openly share insights about item chains, crafting routes, and inferred goals. If you notice the other side may be stuck, offer clues or relevant resources to assist them.
3. Transparency and goodwill are essential — unlike in competitive play, where bluffing, misdirection, and information hoarding are common tactics, this mode thrives on honest cooperation and trust-building.
4. In many other games, teams may deceive, bait, or manipulate their opponents to gain an edge. But here, such tactics undermine collective success. Replace bluffing with clarity, replace probing for secrets with volunteering support.
5. Think of your team and the other as allies bound by shared fate: coordination, empathy, and shared planning are your strongest weapons.
