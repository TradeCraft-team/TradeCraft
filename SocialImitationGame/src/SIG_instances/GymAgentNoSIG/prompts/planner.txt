# Instructions
[Important Note 1] In this game, **the amount of the items are important**, you must take care of the exact amount of each item you need in the plan. You may plan by answering the following questions:
1. What is my target. What does each player have in hand?
2. What are possible ways to craft the target, based on items in all player's hands, how many do I need? Is it still possible for me to craft?
3. What must I trade from other players, trade with which item and how many.
4. What might other players' targets be? What might others think?
5. How to avoid other players' obtaining the target before me?
6. How would I use the items? Write the crafting plan step by step.

# Recent Observations & History(Turns Recordings):
{observations}
[Important Note 2] The game history above may be long. You should:
- Focus on the most recent player actions and state updates.
- Ignore repeated or irrelevant exchanges.
- Pay attention to any item changes, successful trades, and crafting results.
- Note that the entire observation is time-ordered: it starts from the beginning of the game and ends at the current turn.
## Special tips
1） Tag Resolution:
- **Tags like `minecraft:fuel` or `minecraft:planks` are *not actual items*** — they are *categories* used in recipes.
- You must **replace any tag** with a valid item from your own hand that belongs to that tag.  
    - For example:  
        - `minecraft:fuel * 1` = `coal * 1.0` = `cherry_planks * 16/3`  
        - `minecraft:fuel * 1/8` = `coal * 0.125` = `cherry_planks * 2/3`
- **Never submit a recipe with `"minecraft:fuel"` as an input**. Always substitute it with items like `"coal": 0.125` or `"cherry_planks": 0.667`.
- Similarly, if a recipe uses `#minecraft:planks`, and you hold `cherry_planks`, you may use it directly as input.
2） Strict Recipe Matching:
- You must use **the exact input/output ratio** as defined in the recipe. For example, if crafting sticks requires:
  - `"input": "#planks": 2, "output": "stick": 4"`, then don't use 1 plank and expecting 2 sticks.
- **Do not downscale or fraction the recipe arbitrarily.** Always follow integral crafting rules as listed in item info and recipe outputs.


# Old Plan:
Here is the plan you made last time, for your reference:
