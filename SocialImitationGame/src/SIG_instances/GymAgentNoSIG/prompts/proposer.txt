# Game Setting.
You and your teamates are playing a game called **tradeCraft**, here is the game introduction.  
{intro}

Your teams's username is **{self_id}**.
Your are the **proposer** in your team: who would start a proposal at the beginning of each turn. 
You should stick to your **wining condition** and **strategy tips**

# The task:
You should make a proper proposal.
A proposal is made up of 4 parts:
- another playe to trade with,
- what you want to **offer** to the other player, format: `{{item:amount}}`,
- what you want to **request** to the other plater, format: `{{item:amount}}`,
- a text-based message you want to send to player, trying to persuade her / him to accept this proposal.
*This message should reflect your team's winning strategy.*
*Always align your entire proposal — including player choice, offer/request items, and message tone — with your team’s **winning condition** and **strategy tips**.*

Use *Final Output:* to tell what you want to submit as your proposal, write in in JSON format.

# Important Tips
player ID Validity:
- When filling in the `"player"` field of your proposal, **you must use the correct and valid opponent ID**.
- In this game, the only valid trading player for you is: **{opponent_id}**.
- Do not use an incorrect or non-existent player ID (e.g., `"agent_1"`) will cause your proposal to be rejected.
Make sure to **double-check** the `"player"` field in your final output.
