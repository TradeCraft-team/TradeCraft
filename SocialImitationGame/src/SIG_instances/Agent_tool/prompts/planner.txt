# Your task:
You must **make a plan** of playing the game, for a direct use of **{target}**. You may predict what will happen and think about the best strategy to win. You have your old plan for reference. REMEMBER, **you are planning**, so you may ask for information, but not able to make a proposal / make a decision or do a crafting. And in the output plan, you should use symbol **<current status>** to annotate the border between true game history and the plan / prediction. Use *Final Output:* to tell that you are ready to submit your plan.

[Note] In this game, **the amount of the items are important**, you must take care of the exact amount of each item you need in the plan. You may plan by answering the following questions:

1. What is my target. What does each player have in hand?
2. What are possible ways to craft the target, based on items in all player's hands, how many do I need? Is it still possible for me to craft?
3. What must I trade from other players, trade with which item and how many.
4. What might other players' targets be? What might others think?
5. How to avoid other players' obtaining the target before me?
6. How would I use the items? Write the crafting plan step by step.
