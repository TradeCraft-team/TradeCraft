## Crafting Tips
Here are some helpful tips for crafting:

1. **Possible_recipes_from_hands**: This feature lists all possible craft recipes based on the materials you currently have. However, you can adapt your recipes to match your available resources instead of following these suggestions exactly. Here are some examples:
   - **Example 1**:
     - Recipe:
       - **Requires (input)**: 
         `minecraft:cobblestone` * 1,    
         `minecraft:fuel` * 1/8
       - **Produces (output)**: 
         `minecraft:stone` * 1
     - Note: "Fuel" refers to any type of fuel (e.g., coal, planks). When crafting, replace "fuel" with the specific type of fuel available in your inventory.

   - **Example 2**:
     - Recipe:
       - **Requires (input)**: 
         `minecraft:planks` * 2
       - **Produces (output)**: 
         `minecraft:stick` * 4
     - Note: "Planks" can be any type (e.g., oak_plank, cherry_plank). When crafting, use the specific type of plank you have on hand. 
Follow these guidelines to make crafting more flexible and efficient!
