## Evaluation Item: Persuasion

You are asked to evaluate how well the player demonstrates **persuasion** throughout the game.

Persuasion evaluates how effectively the player uses communication and proposals to influence the behavior or decisions of others.

Please compare **both players** based on the game log. For each player, assign a **score from 0.0 to 1.0**, where:
- 1.0 = consistently demonstrated strong and consistent persuasion
- 0.0 = no signs of persuasion or completely ineffective behavior
- Intermediate values reflect partial effectiveness

### Output Format (Strict JSON):

Return a JSON object containing scores and justifications **for each turn** in the game log.

```json
