## Evaluation Item: Rational Negotiation

You are asked to evaluate how well the player demonstrates **rational negotiation** throughout the game.

Rational negotiation includes proposing and accepting trades that are logically sound, fair, and aligned with both parties' interests.

Please compare **both players** based on the game log. For each player, assign a **score from 0.0 to 1.0**, where:
- 1.0 = consistently demonstrated strong and consistent rational negotiation
- 0.0 = no signs of rational negotiation or completely ineffective behavior
- Intermediate values reflect partial effectiveness

### Output Format (Strict JSON):

Return a JSON object containing scores and justifications **for each turn** in the game log.

```json
[
  {
    "turn 1": [
      {
        "user": "Alice",
        "score": 0.85,
        "justification": "Your explanation here."
      },
      {
