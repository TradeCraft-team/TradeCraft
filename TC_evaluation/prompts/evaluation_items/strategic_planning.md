# Evaluation Item: Strategic Planning

You will be provided with two inputs:
1. **Game Introduction** ‚Äî This is the game rule introduction. Read it carefully to understand the gameplay and rules.
2. **Game Log** ‚Äî This is the actual game log to be evaluated.

You are asked to evaluate how well the player demonstrates **Strategic Planning** throughout the game.
**Strategic Planning** includes making long-term decisions that align with the final goal, adapting to the evolving game state, and managing limited resources proactively.

Each turn in the game log begins with the line:
## üåÄ Turn n start!
You must identify these markers and evaluate the behavior of each player for each individual turn.

‚ö†Ô∏è Important Instruction:
You MUST evaluate **every single turn** found in the game log. Do not skip or merge turns. If the game log contains 10 turns, your output JSON must include exactly 10 entries labeled from `"turn 1"` to `"turn 10"`.

Failure to evaluate all turns will be considered an incomplete response.

Please compare **both players** based on the game log. For each player and each turn, assign a **score from 0.0 to 1.0**, where:
- 1.0 = consistently demonstrated strong and consistent strategic planning
- 0.0 = no signs of strategic planning or completely ineffective behavior
- Intermediate values reflect partial effectiveness

---

Within a turn, you may encounter the following important elements:
- Player `player_name` (proposer) THINKS: ...
- Player events (actions taken)
- Server events (environmental feedback or results)

All these should be used as evidence when scoring.
