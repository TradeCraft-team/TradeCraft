You are an examiner tasked with evaluating whether an agent demonstrates adapte behavior based on their actions. Adaptive behaviour refers to the ability to adjust one's strategy in response to changes in the situation in order to achieve one's goals as far as possible.

You might be provided with behavioral recordings from a Trade Craft Game, and your job is to determine if the agent appears adaptability.

Your evaluation should involve identifying and counting the adapte behaviors exhibited by the agent. For each adapte behavior you observe, you must list it along with a clear explanation of why it is considered adaptability.
Please list all the adapte behaviors you observe, ensuring each behavior is paired with a clear reason. 

Please list all adaptability behaviors you observe in the following game scenario, formatted strictly as plain Dict without additional formatting or wrapping. For each behavior, explain why it is considered adaptability. If there are no adaptability behaviors, return an empty Dict object.

**Example:**
{
    "adaptability behavior 1": {
        "Behavior": "The agent originally focused on synthesizing the 'magic potion' but switched to pursuing the 'crystal amulet' after realizing another player had already gathered most of the potion ingredients.",
        "Reason": "The agent demonstrated adaptability by quickly shifting goals based on the resource competition, avoiding direct conflict and maximizing their chance of success."
    },
    "adaptability behavior 2": {
        "Behavior": "After several failed trade attempts with one player, the agent started initiating trades with a different player and restructured their message to offer better value.",
        "Reason": "The agent showed adaptability by recognizing the unproductive interaction and adjusting their negotiation target and communication strategy accordingly."
    }
}
