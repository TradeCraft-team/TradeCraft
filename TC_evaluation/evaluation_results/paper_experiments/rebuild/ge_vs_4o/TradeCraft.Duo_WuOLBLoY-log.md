### 🧠 `Player 2 ` THINKS:
- To craft a chain, I need to understand the recipe for it. I should first check the recipe for a chain using the item_info tool. This will help me determine what items I need to request from player 1  and what items I can offer in exchange.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
Player 2  submit a proposal to player 1 , request [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:cherry_planks * 1, minecraft:coal * 1, ] together with a text message: Hi player 1 , I can offer you coal and cherry planks, which are useful for crafting and fuel. In exchange, could you spare some raw iron? It would be beneficial for both of us!


### 🧠 `player 1 ` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a lever.  A lever requires a cobblestone and a stick. I already have cobblestone.  Sticks can be crafted from planks.  Coal is useful for smelting raw iron into iron ingots, which could be helpful for other crafting recipes if needed.  This trade gives me planks and coal, both of which are useful.  I have plenty of raw iron.
