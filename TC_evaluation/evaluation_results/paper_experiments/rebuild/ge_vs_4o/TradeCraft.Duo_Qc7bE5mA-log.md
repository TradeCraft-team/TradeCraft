## 🌀 Turn 1 start!
----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `player 1 ` THINKS:
- I need to figure out the recipe for a chain. Let's use the `item_info` tool to get the crafting recipe.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1  checked the item info of craft: **chain**.


### 🧠 `player 1 ` THINKS:
- Okay, I need either 1 iron ingot and 2 iron nuggets, or 4 iron nuggets. I have 1 iron ingot, so it would be ideal to get 2 iron nuggets from Player 2 . However, since iron nuggets aren't a raw material, it's unlikely they have them.  They do have raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots.  Perhaps I can trade for some raw iron.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1  checked the item info of craft: **iron_nugget**.


### 🧠 `player 1 ` THINKS:
- I can offer them my coal, which they might need for smelting. I'll request 2 raw iron in return.  This gives me a chance to make the chain next turn.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1  submit a proposal to Player 2 , request [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:coal * 1, ] together with a text message: I have an iron ingot and would like to craft a chain.  I can offer you some coal in exchange for 2 raw iron.  Let me know if you're interested in trading.


### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
Player 2  decided to reject the proposal with a text message: Maximum number of iterations reached without outputting correct information


### 🧠 `player 1 ` THINKS:
- My target is 1 chain. I have cherry planks, coal, cobblestone, iron ingot, and raw copper. My opponent has cobblestone, oak planks, raw copper, and raw iron.  I need to figure out how to craft a chain.
- I need to see the recipe for a chain.  Let's see what the item info tool tells me.  <current status>
- Assuming the recipe for a chain is 2 iron ingots and the item_info confirms this, I already have one iron ingot. I need one more. My opponent has 5 raw iron.  I could try to trade my raw copper for one of their raw iron, then smelt it into an iron ingot.
- I need to consider what my opponent might be trying to craft. They have a lot of raw iron, so maybe they need iron ingots for something.  They also have oak planks and cobblestone.  Perhaps they are trying to make a crafting table, or maybe tools.  I'll need to be careful not to give them too much of what they need.
- My plan is to offer my raw copper for one of their raw iron. If they accept, I can smelt the raw iron into an iron ingot and then craft the chain.

### 🧠 `player 1 ` THINKS:
- My target is 1 chain. I have cherry planks, coal, cobblestone, iron ingot, and raw copper. My opponent has cobblestone, oak planks, raw copper, and raw iron.  I need to figure out how to craft a chain.
- I'm waiting for the item_info on "chain" to tell me the recipe.  Once I know the recipe, I can determine my next steps.  I suspect it requires iron ingots.  If so, I'll need to trade for more raw iron or find another way to acquire iron ingots.
- My opponent has a lot of raw iron.  I'll likely need to trade with them to get some.  I need to think about what they might want in return.  They have oak planks, so they might not need my cherry planks.  They also have raw copper, so they might not need mine either.  Cobblestone is a common item, so offering that might not be enticing.  My coal might be valuable to them for smelting.
- I'll plan to offer my raw copper for one of their raw iron. If that doesn't work, I'll offer my coal.  I'll need to be prepared to adjust my offer based on their response.

### 🧠 `Player 2 ` THINKS:
- I need to confirm the recipe for crafting a stone_shovel and see if there are any additional requirements or alternative methods to obtain it.
- I have gathered the necessary information about crafting a stone_shovel and sticks. Now, I need to determine if I can craft the stone_shovel with my current resources or if I need to trade for additional items.
- I have checked the possible recipes I can craft with my current hand. I can craft sticks from oak_planks, which will allow me to craft the stone_shovel.
- I need to plan my crafting steps. First, I will craft sticks from oak_planks. Then, I will use the sticks and cobblestone to craft the stone_shovel.
- I should also consider the possibility of trading with player 1  if they have items that could help me craft the stone_shovel more efficiently or if I need additional resources.
- I think I have a good plan.

### 🧠 `player 1 ` THINKS:
- My target is 1 chain. I have cherry planks, coal, cobblestone, iron ingot, and raw copper. My opponent has cobblestone, oak planks, raw copper, and raw iron.  I need to figure out how to craft a chain.
- Waiting for the `item_info` action to return the recipe for a chain.  I'm anticipating it will require iron ingots.  My opponent has a good supply of raw iron, so trading will be key.

## 🌀 Turn 2 start!
----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `Player 2 ` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a stone_shovel. To do this, I need to know the recipe for a stone_shovel and determine what items I need. I currently have cobblestone, oak_planks, raw_copper, and raw_iron. I should first find out the recipe for a stone_shovel to see what materials are required.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
Player 2  checked the item info of craft: **stone_shovel**.


### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`

### 🧠 `Player 2 ` THINKS:
- I will propose a trade to player 1  offering raw_iron in exchange for cherry_planks. This aligns with my strategy to acquire the necessary materials to craft a stone_shovel.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
Player 2  submit a proposal to player 1 , request [minecraft:cherry_planks * 1, ], offer [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ] together with a text message: Hi player 1 , I noticed you have cherry_planks which I could use to craft sticks for my stone_shovel. I'm willing to trade 2 raw iron for 1 cherry_planks. Let me know if you're interested!


### 🧠 `player 1 ` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a chain.  I need 2 iron ingots and 1 chain to craft it. I currently have 1 iron ingot. Trading for 2 raw iron would allow me to smelt them into 2 iron ingots, giving me enough to craft the chain.  This trade seems beneficial to me.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1  checked the item info of craft: **chain**.


### 🧠 `player 1 ` THINKS:
- Confirming that 2 raw iron can be smelted into 2 iron ingots.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1  decided to accept the proposal with a text message: I'll trade my cherry planks for your raw iron.  Thanks!


### 🧠 `player 1 ` THINKS:
- My target is a chain. I need 2 iron ingots and 1 raw iron to craft it. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron. I need to acquire one more iron ingot.  Player 2  has 3 raw iron. I could trade my copper ingot for 1 or 2 of their raw iron, then smelt the raw iron into an iron ingot.
- I need to confirm the chain recipe.  I also want to see what Player 2  might be trying to craft.  They traded for cherry planks last turn, which could be used for sticks, which are components in many tools.
- Knowing the recipes for sticks will help me anticipate Player 2 's actions.  They also have oak planks, which could be used for the same purpose.  I should consider what tools they might be making and if I have any components they might need.
- This will tell me what I can craft directly with my current resources.  It's unlikely I can craft the chain directly, but it's good to check.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

### 🧠 `Player 2 ` THINKS:
- ** My target item is a stone shovel. To craft a stone shovel, I need to know the exact recipe and the items required. Currently, I have the following items in my hand:  - minecraft:cherry_planks: 1 - minecraft:cobblestone: 1 - minecraft:oak_planks: 1 - minecraft:raw_copper: 2 - minecraft:raw_iron: 3  I need to determine the recipe for a stone shovel and assess whether I have the necessary items or if I need to trade for them.
- ** I need to understand the recipe for crafting a stone shovel. Once I have the recipe, I can determine if I have the necessary items or if I need to trade for additional items. I also need to consider what items my opponent might need and how I can use that information strategically.
- ** I have gathered information on the stone shovel recipe and the possible recipes I can craft with my current hand. Now, I need to analyze this information to create a crafting plan. I should also consider the opponent's hand and potential target items to anticipate their strategy.

- Confirming the chain recipe.
- Checking what I can craft directly.  I likely need to acquire fuel before I can smelt the raw iron.
