## üåÄ Turn 1 start!
----------------------------------------

### üß† `Player 2 ` THINKS:
- To achieve my team's goal of crafting a bucket, I need to understand the crafting recipe for a bucket and determine what resources I need. I currently have an iron ingot, which is a key component for crafting a bucket in Minecraft. However, I need to confirm the exact recipe to ensure I have all necessary items or can trade for them.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
Player 2  checked the item info of craft: **bucket**.


### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
Player 2  submit a proposal to player 1 , request [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:coal * 1, ] together with a text message: Hi player 1 ! I see you have some raw iron, and I could really use a couple to work towards my crafting goal. I'm offering coal, which could be useful for your smelting needs. Let's help each other out!


### üß† `player 1 ` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a stone shovel.  A stone shovel requires cobblestone and sticks. I already have cobblestone. Sticks are crafted from planks. I have oak planks, so I can make sticks.  I don't need coal for this.  Trading away raw iron doesn't hurt my plan.
- Accepting the trade gives me coal, which I could potentially use later for smelting if needed. It might be beneficial to have some fuel on hand.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1  checked the item info of craft: **stone_shovel**.


### üß† `player 1 ` THINKS:
- I have enough oak planks to make sticks, and I have the cobblestone.  The coal isn't necessary for my goal, but it could be useful later.  Accepting the trade seems slightly beneficial.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1  decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Thanks!  I can use the coal.


### üñ• Server Event: `server__update_all_hands`

### üß† `player 1 ` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I need cobblestone and sticks. I have cobblestone.  I need to craft sticks. Sticks require planks. I have oak_planks.
- Confirming the stick recipe.  Also checking if there's a more direct way to get a stone_shovel.
- Okay, confirmed.  Need planks for sticks, then sticks and cobblestone for the shovel. I have enough oak_planks and cobblestone.  I traded away some raw_iron for coal, which I don't need right now.  Hopefully, Player 2  needs it for their target.  <current status>
- I have everything I need to craft the stone_shovel.

### üß† `Player 2 ` THINKS:
- ** My target is to craft a bucket. To craft a bucket in Minecraft, I need 3 iron ingots. Currently, I have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron. I need to smelt the raw iron into iron ingots using a furnace, which requires fuel. I have cherry planks that can be used as fuel. I need to check if I can craft a furnace with the items I have.
- ** I need to know the recipe for crafting a furnace to proceed with smelting the raw iron into iron ingots.
- ** I need to confirm the recipe for crafting a bucket to ensure I have the correct plan.
- ** I have confirmed that I need 3 iron ingots to craft a bucket. I have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots using a furnace. I need to craft a furnace first.

- Confirming the stick recipe and the amount of planks needed.  Also checking if there's a more direct way to get a stone_shovel.
- I don't have enough oak_planks to make sticks. I need one more.  I can't craft the stone_shovel this turn. I'll need to try and trade for more planks next turn.  Player 2  has cherry_planks, which could work.  I'll offer them some raw_iron or raw_copper.

- ** I need to verify the recipe for smelting raw iron into iron ingots and ensure I have enough fuel to complete the process. This will help me determine if I need to trade for more fuel or if I can proceed with crafting using my current resources.

I can smelt raw iron into iron ingots using a furnace, but I need fuel like coal to do so. Player 1  has coal, which I need. I should propose a trade that helps me get coal from player 1 .

### üß† `player 1 ` THINKS:

- My target is a stone_shovel. I need 2 sticks and 1 cobblestone. I have 2 cobblestone and 1 oak_planks. I need another oak_planks to craft 2 sticks.  Player 2  has no oak_planks. I will try to trade raw_iron for oak_planks in the next turn. If that fails, I'll have to rethink my strategy.  <current status>
- I will check possible recipes from my hand.
- I will also check the recipes for stick and stone_shovel.

### üß† `Player 2 ` THINKS:
- ** My target item is a bucket. To craft a bucket, I need three iron ingots. Currently, I have two iron ingots, one raw iron, one raw copper, and one coal. I need to smelt the raw iron into an iron ingot using the furnace, which requires fuel. I have coal, which can be used as fuel. I need to check if I can craft the bucket with the items I have after smelting the raw iron.
- ** I need to confirm the recipe for crafting a bucket and ensure I have the necessary items. Once I have the recipe, I can plan the crafting steps accordingly.
- ** I have confirmed that I need three iron ingots to craft a bucket. I currently have two iron ingots and one raw iron, which can be smelted into an iron ingot using coal as fuel. I will smelt the raw iron first and then craft the bucket.

- My target is a stone_shovel. I need 2 sticks and 1 cobblestone. I have 2 cobblestone and 1 oak_planks. I need another oak_planks to craft 2 sticks. Player 2  has no oak_planks.  This is problematic. I need to find another way to get sticks or a stone shovel.  <current status>
- I will check possible recipes from my hand to see if there are any alternative crafting paths.
- I will also check the recipes for stick and stone_shovel again to make sure I haven't missed anything.
- I need to consider what Player 2  might be crafting.  They traded for coal and raw iron.  Perhaps they are making shears or an iron tool.  Knowing their target might help me devise a better trading strategy.
- I think I have a plan.
