## 🌀 Turn 1 start!
----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `Player 2 ` THINKS:
- To achieve my team's goal of crafting 1 shears, I need to understand the crafting recipe for shears and determine what resources I need. I currently have 1 iron ingot, which is a key component for crafting shears. I should check the recipe for shears to confirm the required materials.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
Player 2  checked the item info of craft: **shears**.


### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
Player 2  checked the item info of craft: **raw_iron**.


### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
Player 2  submit a proposal to player 1 , request [minecraft:raw_iron * 1, ], offer [minecraft:coal * 1, ] together with a text message: Hi player 1 , I noticed you have raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots. I can offer you coal, a useful fuel for smelting, in exchange for 1 raw iron. This trade could benefit both of us in our crafting goals. Let me know if you're interested!


### 🧠 `player 1 ` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a torch.  A torch requires a stick and coal. I have plenty of raw iron, and I can use coal to smelt the raw iron into iron ingots, but that doesn't help me get a torch.  Trading for coal directly gets me closer to my goal.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1  decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Sounds good. Thanks!


### 🖥 Server Event: `server__update_all_hands`

- Confirming the stick recipe.  I also want to check what I can do with the raw copper and iron I have.
- I think I have a good plan.

### 🧠 `Player 2 ` THINKS:
- ** My target is to craft 1 shears. To craft shears in Minecraft, I need 2 iron ingots. Currently, I have 1 iron ingot and 1 raw iron. I need to smelt the raw iron into an iron ingot. I also have coal, which can be used as fuel for smelting.

- Confirming the stick recipe. I'll need 2 planks for 4 sticks. I only have one plank, so I can only make 2 sticks.  <current status>

### 🧠 `player 1 ` THINKS:
- My target is a torch. I have coal and oak planks. I need sticks.  I traded for the coal successfully. I only have one oak plank, enough for 2 sticks.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
Player 2  submit a proposal to player 1 , request [minecraft:coal * 1, ], offer [minecraft:cobblestone * 1, ] together with a text message: Hi player 1 , I need some coal to smelt my raw iron. Would you be interested in trading your coal for my cobblestone? It could be useful for your crafting needs. Thanks!


### 🧠 `player 1 ` THINKS:
- My target is a torch, which requires coal and a stick. I already have coal and I can craft sticks from planks.  Trading my coal for cobblestone doesn't help me get closer to my goal. I need to keep the coal.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1  decided to reject the proposal with a text message: Thanks for the offer, but I need the coal for my own crafting plans.


### 🧠 `player 1 ` THINKS:
- My target is a torch. I need coal and a stick. I have coal, but I need to craft a stick.  To craft a stick, I need planks. I have oak planks.
- Confirming the stick recipe.  I also want to check what I can do with the raw copper and iron I have.  Maybe I can trade them later for something useful.
- I have enough oak planks to make sticks, and I have coal. I can craft a torch this turn.  <current status>
- I have everything I need to craft a torch.  I'll craft sticks from my oak planks, then craft the torch using the sticks and coal.

### 🧠 `player 1 ` THINKS:
- My target is a torch. I have coal and oak planks. I can craft sticks from the planks and then combine a stick and coal to make a torch.
- Confirmed the stick recipe requires 2 planks for 4 sticks. I have enough planks and coal to make at least one torch.

### 🧠 `Player 2 ` THINKS:
- ** My target is to craft a "shears." To do this, I need to understand the crafting recipe for shears and determine if I have the necessary items or if I need to trade for them. Currently, I have the following items in my hand:  - minecraft:cherry_planks: 1 - minecraft:cobblestone: 1 - minecraft:iron_ingot: 1 - minecraft:raw_copper: 1 - minecraft:raw_iron: 1  I need to find out the recipe for crafting shears and see if I can craft it with my current items or if I need to trade for additional resources.
- ** I need to know the recipe for shears to determine the next steps in my crafting plan.
- ** Now that I have the recipe for shears, I can plan my next steps. Shears typically require iron ingots. I have one iron ingot, but I need to confirm the exact amount required for crafting shears.
- ** I need to confirm the exact amount of iron ingots required to craft shears and see if I need to trade for more.
