## 🌀 Turn 1 start!
----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `Player 2 ` THINKS:
- To craft a bucket, I need to know the recipe for it. I should first find out what items are required to craft a bucket. Then, I can determine what items I need to request from player 1  and what items I can offer in exchange.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
Player 2  checked the item info of craft: **bucket**.


### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
Player 2  submit a proposal to player 1 , request [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:cherry_planks * 1, minecraft:coal * 1, ] together with a text message: Hi player 1 , I see you have some raw iron. I can offer you cherry planks and coal, which might be useful for your crafting needs. Let's help each other out!


### 🧠 `player 1 ` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a lever.  A lever requires a cobblestone and a stick. I already have cobblestone.  Sticks can be crafted from planks.  While I already have oak planks, getting cherry planks would give me more options. Coal is useful for smelting raw iron into iron ingots, which could be helpful for other crafting recipes.  This trade seems beneficial.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1  decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Sounds good!  Let's trade.

- I have enough planks to make a stick. I'll craft a stick and then craft the lever.  <current status>
