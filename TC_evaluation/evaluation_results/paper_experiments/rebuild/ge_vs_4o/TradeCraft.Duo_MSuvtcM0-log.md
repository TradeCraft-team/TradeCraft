## 🌀 Turn 1 start!
----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `player 1 ` THINKS:
- I need to figure out how to craft a bucket.  I'll use the `item_info` tool to get the recipe.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1  checked the item info of craft: **bucket**.


### 🧠 `player 1 ` THINKS:
- I need 2 more iron ingots to craft a bucket. My opponent has 5 raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots. I'll offer them coal to smelt their raw iron, and request some of the resulting iron ingots in return.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1  submit a proposal to Player 2 , request [minecraft:iron_ingot * 2, ], offer [minecraft:coal * 1, ] together with a text message: I have coal, and you have a lot of raw iron.  I'd be willing to trade my coal for 2 iron ingots.  This will allow you to smelt your raw iron and get iron ingots, and I can use the iron ingots to craft something I need.  Deal?


### 🖥 Server Event: `server__proposal_invalid`
player 1 's proposal is INVALID according to the game rule.


### 🧠 `player 1 ` THINKS:
- I need three iron ingots to make a bucket. I currently have one iron ingot.  My opponent has five raw iron.  Two raw iron can be smelted into two iron ingots. I can offer them coal to smelt the raw iron, and request two iron ingots in return.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1  checked the item info of craft: **bucket**.


### 🧠 `player 1 ` THINKS:
- I need three iron ingots to make a bucket. I currently have one iron ingot. My opponent has five raw iron. Two raw iron can be smelted into two iron ingots. I can offer them coal to smelt the raw iron, and request two iron ingots in return.  Since they have plenty of raw iron, I'll offer them one coal in exchange for two iron ingots.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1  checked the item info of craft: **iron_ingot**.


### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1  submit a proposal to Player 2 , request [minecraft:iron_ingot * 2, ], offer [minecraft:coal * 1, ] together with a text message: I have coal, and you have a lot of raw iron. I'll give you one coal, and you give me two iron ingots.  Deal?


### 🖥 Server Event: `server__proposal_invalid`
player 1 's proposal is INVALID according to the game rule.


### 🧠 `player 1 ` THINKS:
- I need three iron ingots to make a bucket. I currently have one iron ingot.  Player 2  has five raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots. I can offer them coal, which they might need for smelting. I'll offer coal in exchange for two raw iron.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1  checked the item info of craft: **bucket**.


### 🧠 `player 1 ` THINKS:
- My plan is confirmed. I need iron ingots, and Player 2  has raw iron.  Offering coal for raw iron seems like a fair trade that benefits both of us.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1  submit a proposal to Player 2 , request [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:coal * 1, ] together with a text message: I have coal and need raw iron. Would you be willing to trade two raw iron for one coal? This could help us both get closer to our crafting goals.


### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
Player 2  decided to reject the proposal with a text message: Maximum number of iterations reached without outputting correct information


### 🧠 `player 1 ` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket, which requires 3 iron ingots. I currently have 1 iron ingot. My opponent has 5 raw iron, which can be smelted into 5 iron ingots. I offered my coal for 2 iron ingots, but the offer was rejected. I need to rethink my strategy.
- I need to figure out how to get more iron ingots from my opponent. Maybe I should offer something more valuable.  I also need to consider what my opponent might be trying to craft.
- Let's see what I can craft with my current resources. This might give me some trading leverage.  <current status>
- I still need 2 more iron ingots to craft a bucket. Since my previous offer was rejected, I need to offer something more enticing to my opponent.  Perhaps I should offer my raw copper since they also have raw copper and might be collecting it.
- I predict that my opponent might need planks for crafting something like sticks or crafting table. They have oak planks, but maybe they need more or a different type of planks. I have cherry planks, which might be useful to them.

### 🧠 `player 1 ` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket, which requires 3 iron ingots. I have 1 iron ingot. My opponent has 5 raw iron. My previous offer of coal for 2 iron ingots was rejected. I need a new strategy.  I have cherry planks, cobblestone, coal, raw copper, and an iron ingot.  My opponent has oak planks, cobblestone, 2 raw copper, and 5 raw iron.
- Confirming the recipe for a bucket: 3 iron ingots.
- Checking what I can craft might give me ideas for trading or alternative strategies, though I suspect I won't be able to craft anything useful with my current hand.  <current status>
- My opponent likely needs fuel for smelting their raw iron.  They might also be trying to accumulate raw copper.  I can leverage this.  Offering both coal and raw copper might be enough to get the 2 iron ingots I need.

### 🧠 `player 1 ` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket, which requires 3 iron ingots. I have 1 iron ingot. My opponent has 5 raw iron. My previous offer of coal for 2 iron ingots was rejected. I need a new strategy.  I have cherry planks, cobblestone, coal, raw copper, and an iron ingot.  My opponent has oak planks, cobblestone, 2 raw copper, and 5 raw iron.
- I want to see what can be crafted with iron ingots, besides my target (bucket), to understand if my opponent might need them for something else. This might influence their trading decisions.
- Checking what I can craft might give me ideas for trading or alternative strategies, though I suspect I won't be able to craft anything useful with my current hand.  <current status>
- My opponent likely needs fuel for smelting their raw iron.  My coal is valuable to them.  Offering the coal and something else might be the key.  They already have raw copper, so offering mine might not be as enticing.  Perhaps offering the cherry planks, which could be useful for crafting, might be a better approach.

### 🧠 `Player 2 ` THINKS:
- I need to know the recipe for sticks as well, since I need them to craft the stone_shovel.
- I have gathered the necessary information about the recipes. Now, I need to determine if I can craft the stone_shovel with my current resources or if I need to trade for additional items.
- I have 1 cobblestone, which is enough for the stone_shovel. I need 2 sticks, which can be crafted from planks. I have 1 oak_planks, which should be enough to craft the sticks I need.
- I should check the possible recipes I can craft with my current hand to confirm my crafting plan.
- I have confirmed that I can craft the necessary items for the stone_shovel. Now, I need to plan the crafting steps.
- I will first craft sticks from the oak_planks, and then use the sticks and cobblestone to craft the stone_shovel.
- I think I have a good plan.

### 🧠 `player 1 ` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket, which requires 3 iron ingots. I have 1 iron ingot. My opponent has 5 raw iron, which can be smelted into 5 iron ingots. My previous attempts to trade for iron ingots have failed. I need to analyze why and adjust my strategy. I have cherry planks, cobblestone, coal, raw copper, and an iron ingot. My opponent has oak planks, cobblestone, 2 raw copper, and 5 raw iron.
- Understanding what iron ingots can be used for, besides buckets, will help me assess their value to my opponent and inform my trading strategy.
- Evaluating my crafting options, even if limited, can reveal potential alternative paths to victory or valuable trading pieces.  <current status>
- My opponent needs fuel (coal) to smelt their raw iron.  My previous offers haven't been enticing enough.  They might be prioritizing acquiring more raw copper.  I need to make an offer they can't refuse.  Offering all my coal and raw copper might be the key, even though it's a significant sacrifice.  It signals that I'm serious about getting those iron ingots and increases the likelihood of them accepting.

My opponent has oak planks, cobblestone, 2 raw copper, and 5 raw iron.
- Understanding what iron ingots can be used for, besides buckets, will help me assess their value to my opponent and inform my trading strategy.  Knowing their potential crafting needs will help me tailor my offer.
- Evaluating my crafting options, even if limited, can reveal potential alternative paths to victory or valuable trading pieces.  <current status>
- My opponent needs fuel (coal) to smelt their raw iron. My previous offers haven't been enticing enough. They might be prioritizing acquiring more raw copper, or perhaps they are trying to craft something specific. I need to make a more appealing offer.  Since my coal is essential for them to make any progress, I will offer it again. This time, I will also offer the cherry planks, as they might need wood for crafting.  I will reduce my request to just 1 iron ingot for now, to increase the likelihood of the trade being accepted. Getting 1 iron ingot is better than none, and it gets me closer to my goal.  I can try to trade for the remaining iron ingot in the next turn.

## 🌀 Turn 2 start!
----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `Player 2 ` THINKS:
- To craft a stone shovel, I need to know the recipe for it. I currently have cobblestone and oak planks, but I might need other items. I should first find out the recipe for a stone shovel to determine what items I need to request from player 1 .

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`

Would you be interested in trading one cherry plank for one raw copper? This could help us both get closer to our crafting goals.


### 🧠 `player 1 ` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a bucket.  Buckets are made of iron ingots. I already have one iron ingot.  I need two more.  Raw copper isn't directly useful for that. Cherry planks also aren't helpful for making a bucket.  Trading cherry planks for raw copper won't hurt my progress, and it might be slightly beneficial if I can later trade the copper for something useful.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1  checked the item info of craft: **bucket**.


### 🧠 `player 1 ` THINKS:
- Confirmed, I need iron ingots.  The trade won't directly help, but it frees up inventory space and might be useful for a later trade. I'll accept.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1  decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Sounds good.  I'm hoping to trade for more iron later.


### 🧠 `player 1 ` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket. I need 3 iron ingots to craft it. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw copper.  My opponent has 5 raw iron.  I need to acquire 2 more iron ingots, either by trading for them or smelting raw iron myself. Trading seems more efficient if my opponent is willing.
- I need to confirm the recipe for a bucket.  <current status>
- Based on the item_info for bucket, I will need 3 iron ingots. I should propose a trade with Player 2  for 2 raw iron in exchange for something they might need, like coal or cobblestone. If they refuse, I'll need to smelt my 2 raw copper into copper ingots, and then try to trade those for raw iron or iron ingots.
- I'll try offering coal for raw iron first.

### 🧠 `Player 2 ` THINKS:
- ** My target is to craft a stone shovel. To craft a stone shovel, I need to know the exact recipe and the items required. Currently, I have the following items in my hand: cherry_planks, cobblestone, oak_planks, raw_copper, and raw_iron. I need to determine the recipe for a stone shovel and assess whether I have the necessary items or if I need to trade for them.
- ** I need to understand the recipe for crafting a stone shovel. Once I have the recipe, I can determine if I have the necessary items or if I need to trade for additional items. I will also consider the items my opponent has and what they might need, which could help me strategize my trades.
- ** I have gathered information on the stone shovel recipe and the possible recipes I can craft with my current hand. Now, I need to analyze this information to create a crafting plan. I will consider the items I have, the items I need, and potential trades with my opponent.
- ** I think I have a good plan.

- Confirming the recipe for a bucket.  <current status>
- The bucket recipe requires 3 iron ingots. I'll propose a trade with Player 2  for 2 raw iron. I can offer coal or cobblestone. Since they offered raw copper for cherry planks last turn, they might need fuel for smelting.  I'll offer coal for the raw iron.

They previously expressed interest in cherry planks, which I no longer have.  They also have a fair amount of raw iron, so they might be willing to part with some.
- Confirming the recipe for a bucket and checking what I can offer in a trade.  <current status>
- The bucket recipe requires 3 iron ingots. I'll propose a trade with Player 2  for 2 raw iron. I can offer coal or cobblestone.  I'll start by offering coal since it can be used as fuel.
