## 🌀 Turn 1 start!
----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `Player 2 ` THINKS:
- To craft a chain, I need to understand the recipe for it and determine what items I need. I should first check the recipe for a chain using the item_info tool.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
Player 2  checked the item info of craft: **chain**.


### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
Player 2  checked the item info of craft: **iron_nugget**.


### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
Player 2  submit a proposal to player 1 , request [minecraft:raw_iron * 1, ], offer [minecraft:raw_copper * 1, ] together with a text message: Hi player 1 , I noticed you have raw iron, which I could use to craft some items. I can offer you raw copper in exchange, which might be useful for your crafting needs. Let's help each other out!


### 🧠 `player 1 ` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a stone shovel.  I need cobblestone and sticks. I already have cobblestone. Sticks are crafted from planks. I have oak planks, so I can make sticks.  Trading raw iron for raw copper doesn't help me get closer to my goal. I have enough raw iron, and getting more raw copper doesn't benefit me. I should reject this trade.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1  decided to reject the proposal with a text message: Thanks for the offer, but I don't need more raw copper right now.


### 🧠 `player 1 ` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I need cobblestone and sticks. I have cobblestone, but I need sticks. Sticks are crafted from planks, and I have oak_planks.  My opponent has raw_copper, coal, cobblestone, and iron_ingot. They tried to trade raw_copper for my raw_iron, which I don't need for my target. I should focus on crafting the stick and then the shovel.
- I need to confirm the stick recipe.  <current status>
- Now I have the recipe for sticks, I can craft them using my oak planks. Then I can craft the stone_shovel using the sticks and cobblestone.

### 🧠 `player 1 ` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I need cobblestone and sticks. I have 1 cobblestone and 1 oak_planks.  I need 2 oak_planks to make sticks. My opponent has raw_copper, coal, cobblestone, and iron_ingot. They tried to trade raw_copper for my raw_iron, which I don't need for my target.  Perhaps I can trade some of my excess raw_iron for their cobblestone. That way I won't need to trade for planks and can keep my oak_planks for future crafting if needed.
- I've confirmed the recipe for a stone_shovel. Now I need to figure out how to get enough cobblestone. I could trade for it.
- I have plenty of raw_iron.  I'll offer 2 raw_iron for 1 cobblestone.

### 🧠 `player 1 ` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I need cobblestone and sticks. I have 1 cobblestone and 1 oak_planks. I need 2 oak_planks to make 4 sticks, and then 2 sticks to make the shovel. My opponent has raw_copper, coal, cobblestone, and iron_ingot. They tried to trade raw_copper for my raw_iron, which I don't need for my target.  I need another oak_plank.  I could try trading some raw_iron for their cobblestone, but ideally, I'd trade for the oak plank if they had any.  Since they have cherry_planks, maybe they can craft something and get oak planks? Unlikely, but worth a shot.  I'll offer a trade for either.
- I've checked the recipe for oak_planks.  It's made from logs.  My opponent doesn't have any logs.  I'll propose a trade for either oak_planks or cobblestone.

### 🧠 `Player 2 ` THINKS:
- I need to understand the recipe for crafting a chain to determine what items I need and what I might need to trade for.
- I have the following items in my hand: cherry_planks, coal, cobblestone, iron_ingot, and raw_copper. I need to see if any of these can be used to craft a chain or if I need to trade for additional items.
- I think I have a good plan.

### 🧠 `player 1 ` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I need cobblestone and sticks. I have 1 cobblestone and 1 oak_planks. I need 2 oak_planks to make 4 sticks, and then 2 sticks to make the shovel. My opponent has raw_copper, coal, cobblestone, and iron_ingot. They tried to trade raw_copper for my raw_iron, which I don't need for my target.  I need another oak_plank.  Trading for it is the best option. I'll offer a trade for it. If that fails, I'll try for cobblestone.
- I've checked the recipe for oak_planks.  It's made from logs.  My opponent doesn't have any logs.  I'll propose a trade for oak_planks first. If that's rejected, I'll propose a trade for cobblestone in the next turn.

### 🖥 Server Event: `server__craft_recipe_validity`

Sorry, there seems to be an issue with your recipe. Please check:
1. The recipe follows Minecraft game rules.
2. You have the required crafts in the necessary quantities.

### 🧠 `Player 2 ` THINKS:
- I need to gather information on the recipe for crafting a chain. Once I have this information, I can determine if I have the necessary items or if I need to trade for them. I also need to consider crafting any intermediate items that might be required for the chain.
- With the information on the chain recipe and the possible recipes I can craft with my current hand, I can now analyze this data to create a plan for crafting the chain. I should also consider what items I might need to trade for and what my opponent might be targeting.
- I have a better understanding of the situation now. I need to focus on crafting the chain by acquiring the necessary items through trades or crafting intermediate items. I should also keep an eye on my opponent's actions to prevent them from achieving their target before me.
