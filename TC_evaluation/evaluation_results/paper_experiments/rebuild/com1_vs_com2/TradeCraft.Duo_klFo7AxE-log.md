player 2 enters the game with a private target: [minecraft:stone_shovel * 1, ]



## üåÄ Turn 1 start!
----------------------------------------

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a bucket.  I need iron ingots for that.  I already have one iron ingot. I need two more. My opponent has a lot of raw iron. I should try to trade for some of that. I'll offer them my coal, which they might need for smelting, and my cherry planks, which are less useful to me.  I'll request two raw iron in return.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **bucket**.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I need 3 iron ingots total for the bucket. I have 1, so I need 2 more.  My opponent has 5 raw iron, which they can smelt into iron ingots.  Trading my coal will help them do that.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:cherry_planks * 1, minecraft:coal * 1, ] together with a text message: I have some extra coal and planks I don't need.  Would you be willing to trade some raw iron? I'm trying to gather resources for a project.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a stone_shovel.  I need cobblestone and sticks. I already have cobblestone. Sticks are crafted from planks.  This trade offers cherry planks, which can be used to make sticks.  They also offer coal, which I don't need right now, but could be useful for smelting later.  I have plenty of raw iron.  This trade seems beneficial to me.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Sounds good.  I could use the planks.


### üñ• Server Event: `server__update_all_hands`
Server updated all hands:
player 1 hand: [minecraft:cobblestone * 1, minecraft:iron_ingot * 1, minecraft:raw_copper * 1, minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ]
player 2 hand: [minecraft:cherry_planks * 1, minecraft:coal * 1, minecraft:cobblestone * 1, minecraft:oak_planks * 1, minecraft:raw_copper * 2, minecraft:raw_iron * 3, ]


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket, which requires 3 iron ingots. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron.  My opponent has 3 raw iron. I traded away some potentially useful items like planks and coal in the last turn, which might have been a mistake. I need to acquire more raw iron to craft more iron ingots.
- I need to review how to make iron ingots to solidify my plan.  Let's see what the opponent might be crafting.
- Confirming the recipe for my target is always good. Now, let's check what I can craft with what I have.
- Based on the possible recipes and my current hand, I need to smelt my raw iron into iron ingots. I'll need fuel for that, which I traded away last turn.  My opponent has coal, so I'll need to trade for that in the next turn.  I'll offer them my raw copper, as I don't currently need it for anything.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I need cobblestone and sticks. I have cobblestone, but I need to craft sticks.  Sticks require planks, and I have both oak_planks and cherry_planks.  My opponent traded away their cherry_planks and coal, likely because they don't need them for their target.  I should analyze what they might be trying to craft.
- Reviewing the recipe for stone_shovel confirms I need cobblestone and sticks.
- This confirms sticks are made from planks. I have enough planks to make the sticks I need. Let's see what recipes I can currently make.
- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket, which requires 3 iron ingots. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron. My opponent has 5 raw iron. I traded away planks and coal last turn. I need more iron ingots, and therefore more raw iron and fuel.  My opponent has coal.
- Reviewing the iron ingot recipe.
- I can't craft anything useful right now. I need to trade for more raw iron and coal.  I can offer my raw copper.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I need cobblestone and sticks. I have cobblestone, but I need to craft sticks.  Sticks require planks, and I have both oak_planks and cherry_planks.  My opponent traded away their cherry_planks and coal, likely because they don't need them for their target.  I should analyze what they might be trying to craft.  They now have 2 raw_iron and already had 1 iron_ingot.  This suggests they might be aiming for iron tools or armor.
- Reviewing the recipe for stone_shovel confirms I need cobblestone and sticks.
- This confirms sticks are made from planks. I have enough planks to make the sticks I need. Let's see what recipes I can currently make.
- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket, which requires 3 iron ingots. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron. My opponent has 5 raw iron. I traded away planks and coal last turn, which was not ideal. I need more iron ingots, and therefore more raw iron and fuel.  My opponent has coal.
- Reviewing the iron ingot recipe to confirm.
- I can't craft anything useful right now. I need to trade for more raw iron and coal.  I can offer my raw copper, but that might not be enough.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I need cobblestone and sticks. I have cobblestone, but I need to craft sticks.  Sticks require planks, and I have both oak_planks and cherry_planks.  My opponent traded for raw_iron.  Combined with their existing iron_ingot and the 2 raw iron they received, they have enough iron to make more iron ingots. They might be aiming for iron tools, armor, or possibly an iron_pickaxe to mine more efficiently.  They kept their cobblestone, so it might be a component of their target as well, perhaps a stone_pickaxe as an intermediate step.

- My target is a bucket, which requires 3 iron ingots. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron. My opponent has 5 raw iron and coal. I traded away planks and coal last turn, which might have been a mistake, but I can try to get them back. I need more iron ingots, and therefore more raw iron and fuel.
- Reviewing the iron ingot recipe to confirm.
- I can't craft anything useful right now. I need to trade for more raw iron and coal.  I can offer my raw copper and cobblestone.  <current status>

- My target is a stone_shovel. I need cobblestone and sticks. I have cobblestone, but I need to craft sticks.  Sticks require planks, and I have both oak_planks and cherry_planks.  My opponent traded for raw_iron.  Combined with their existing iron_ingot and the 2 raw iron they received, they have enough iron to make more iron ingots. They might be aiming for iron tools, armor, an iron_pickaxe, or even a bucket.  They kept their cobblestone, so a stone_pickaxe as an intermediate step is still possible.  Since I have enough materials to craft my target right away, I will do so.
- Confirming the stick recipe.
- I have everything I need.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **iron_ingot**.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:

Since I have enough materials to craft my target right away, I will do so.  I will use oak planks to craft sticks, as I only have one cherry plank.
- Confirming the stick recipe.  2 planks make 4 sticks. I only need 2 sticks, but that's the recipe.
- I have everything I need. Let's craft!
