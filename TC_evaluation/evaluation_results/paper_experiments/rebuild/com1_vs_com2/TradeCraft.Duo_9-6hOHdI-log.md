## 🌀 Turn 1 start!
----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft shears, which requires 2 iron ingots. I currently have 1 iron ingot. My opponent has 5 raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots. I should try to trade for some raw iron.  I also need to consider what my opponent might need and what I can safely offer without helping them too much.  They have a lot of raw materials, so they might be looking for fuel. I have coal, which I could offer a small amount of. I will request 2 raw iron in return.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **shears**.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I will offer a small amount of coal (which they might need for smelting) and request 2 raw iron.  This will give me enough to craft shears if they accept.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:coal * 1, ] together with a text message: I have some coal you might need for smelting.  I'm looking for some raw iron.  Would you be willing to trade 2 raw iron for 1 coal?


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a torch.  A torch requires a stick and coal. I have no coal currently.  This trade would give me coal.  I have 5 raw iron, so I can spare 2.  Getting coal now would put me one step closer to my goal.  Player 1 likely wants the iron to make iron ingots, but that doesn't directly help them make a torch.  This trade seems beneficial to me.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Deal.


### 🖥 Server Event: `server__update_all_hands`
Server updated all hands:
player 1 hand: [minecraft:cherry_planks * 1, minecraft:cobblestone * 1, minecraft:iron_ingot * 1, minecraft:raw_copper * 1, minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ]
player 2 hand: [minecraft:coal * 1, minecraft:cobblestone * 1, minecraft:oak_planks * 1, minecraft:raw_copper * 2, minecraft:raw_iron * 3, ]


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is shears, which requires 2 iron ingots. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron. I need to smelt the raw iron into iron ingots. I traded for coal last turn, so I have enough fuel to smelt the raw iron. My opponent has a lot of raw iron, which could be a threat. I should try to prevent them from getting more iron ingots.
- I'm checking the possible recipes I can craft with my current hand.  <current status>
- Based on the possible recipes, I can smelt my 2 raw iron into 2 iron ingots using my coal as fuel. This will give me a total of 3 iron ingots, enough to craft shears.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a torch. I have coal and sticks are needed to craft torches.  I can craft sticks from planks. I have oak planks. I traded for coal last turn.  My opponent traded away their coal, so they might also need it for something.  They requested raw iron, so they might be trying to make iron ingots.
- I should craft sticks from my oak planks, then craft a torch using the sticks and coal.  <current status>
- I have enough materials to craft a torch now.
- I will check what I can craft from my current hand.  Then I will craft sticks and then the torch.

- I have enough materials to craft a torch now.  I should prioritize crafting the torch immediately.
- I will check what I can craft from my current hand.  Then I will craft sticks and then the torch.
