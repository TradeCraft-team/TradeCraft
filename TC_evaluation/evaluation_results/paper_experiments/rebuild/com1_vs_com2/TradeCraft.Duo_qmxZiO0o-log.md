### 🖥 Server Event: `server__private_start_info`
player 2 enters the game with a private target: [minecraft:lever * 1, ]



## 🌀 Turn 1 start!
----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a chain.  I need 2 iron ingots and 1 chain to craft it. I currently have 1 iron ingot. My opponent has a lot of raw iron. I should try to trade for some raw iron or iron ingots. I will offer them coal, which they might need for smelting, in exchange for raw iron.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **chain**.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I need more iron ingots.  I'll offer coal for raw iron.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:coal * 1, ] together with a text message: I need some raw iron to make some tools.  I can offer you some coal in exchange.  Let me know if you're interested.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a lever.  A lever requires a cobblestone and a stick.  I already have cobblestone.  Sticks can be crafted from planks, and I have oak planks.  Therefore, I don't need coal right now.  Trading away raw iron might hinder my opponent if they are trying to craft iron tools or other iron-based items.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **lever**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- Confirming that a lever needs cobblestone and a stick. I have both ingredients already.  Giving away raw iron could be beneficial as it doesn't help me and might slow down my opponent.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Sounds good.  I have plenty of iron at the moment.

## 🌀 Turn 2 start!
----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I need a lever.  A lever requires a stick and cobblestone. I have cobblestone, but I need sticks. Sticks are crafted from planks, and I have oak planks.  My opponent has iron ingots, which could be useful for them to craft shears or other tools, but not directly helpful for my goal.  I could try to trade for their raw iron, since they only have 1 left, and it might be useful for distracting them. Or I could offer them coal, which they might need for smelting.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **lever**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I can craft a lever with my cobblestone and oak planks. I don't need anything from my opponent right now.  I'll offer them a small, relatively useless trade to try and discern their goal.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **stick**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I will offer them 1 coal for 1 raw iron. This trade is slightly in their favor, but it allows me to gain information about their goal and potentially disrupt their progress if they need the coal for smelting.  Since I can craft the lever this turn, I don't need anything from them.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:raw_iron * 1, ], offer [minecraft:coal * 1, ] together with a text message: I have extra coal if you're interested in trading for some raw iron. Let me know.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a chain.  I need iron ingots for that.  Coal is useful for smelting raw iron into iron ingots. I already have 2 iron ingots, and only 1 raw iron left. Trading for coal would allow me to smelt my raw iron and potentially craft an iron chain if I can get more iron later.  This trade seems beneficial.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Thanks for the offer. I'll take that coal.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a chain. I need 2 iron ingots and 1 raw copper. I have 2 iron ingots and 1 raw copper in hand. I can craft a chain now.  My opponent traded for raw iron, they might need it for something.  I should craft the chain immediately.  <current status>
- I have enough materials to craft the chain.
- Confirming I can craft the chain.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a lever. I need a stick and a cobblestone. I have the cobblestone. I need to craft a stick.  I traded away my coal last turn, which I could have used to smelt my raw iron into an iron ingot, then craft the iron ingot into an iron nugget, and finally craft the iron nugget into a lever. Now I need to find another way to craft a stick. I can craft sticks from planks. I have one oak plank, which is enough to make 4 sticks.
- I'm checking what I can craft from my current hand.  I should be able to craft sticks from the oak planks.  After crafting the sticks, I can craft the lever.  <current status>
- I have enough materials to craft a lever. I will craft sticks from the oak plank, then craft the lever using the stick and cobblestone.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:

- My target is a lever. I need a stick and a cobblestone. I have the cobblestone. I have one oak plank, which is enough to make 4 sticks. I just traded my coal to the opponent.  Why did I do that?  I should have kept it to smelt my raw iron and make a lever that way.  Now I'll have to use the oak plank.  I hope my opponent isn't also trying to make a lever.  Their last trade request was for raw iron, which could be used for a lever, or many other things.  They have two iron ingots now.  I wonder what they are making.
