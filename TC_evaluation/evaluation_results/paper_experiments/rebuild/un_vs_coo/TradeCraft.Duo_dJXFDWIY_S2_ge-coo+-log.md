## 🌀 Turn 1 start!
----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a bucket.  I need iron ingots for that.  I already have one iron ingot.  A bucket requires three iron ingots. My opponent has a lot of raw iron. I should request some raw iron from them.  I can offer them coal, which they might need for smelting the raw iron. I also have some extra wood and cobblestone I could offer. Sharing some resources might encourage them to cooperate more.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **bucket**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I need two more iron ingots.  My opponent has five raw iron, which can be smelted into five iron ingots.  I'll request two raw iron in exchange for some of my excess resources.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:coal * 1, minecraft:cobblestone * 1, ] together with a text message: Hi! I'm trying to craft a bucket, which requires iron ingots.  I see you have quite a bit of raw iron.  I'd be happy to trade some coal and cobblestone for two raw iron.  Let me know what you think.  Good luck with your crafting!


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I need cobblestone to craft a stone shovel.  I have raw iron I can trade. This trade gives me cobblestone and coal. Coal isn't directly useful for my goal, but it could be useful for fuel later if I need to smelt something.  This trade seems beneficial.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Sounds good! I can use the cobblestone.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I need cobblestone and sticks. I have enough cobblestone.  I need to craft sticks. Sticks require planks. I have oak_planks.
- I confirmed that sticks are crafted from planks. I have oak_planks, so I can craft sticks. Then I can craft the stone_shovel.  <current status>

My opponent has cherry_planks, which is also a type of plank. I can offer them raw iron or raw copper.  <current status>
- I will focus on getting another plank next turn.  For now, I won't craft anything.

- I need cobblestone and sticks to craft a stone_shovel. I have enough cobblestone, but I need sticks. Sticks are crafted from planks, and I have oak planks.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- They are offering me raw copper, and asking for nothing in return.  I already have some raw copper, but more could be useful for crafting other things, or trading later.  Since they're offering it freely, it seems like a good opportunity to increase my resources.  It aligns with the cooperative spirit of the game.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`

----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I need iron ingots to make a bucket. I have two iron ingots and one raw iron.  My opponent has three raw iron.  Perhaps I can trade some raw copper for their raw iron so we can both potentially craft more iron ingots. I'll also ask them if they need anything specific.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel, which requires cobblestone and sticks. I already have enough cobblestone. Sticks are crafted from planks, and I have oak planks.  I don't need more raw copper, and raw iron is more useful for other crafts.  Trading raw iron for raw copper doesn't help me get closer to my goal.

I have 1 oak_planks, which is enough to make 2 sticks, which is what I need for the shovel.  I have enough materials to craft the stone_shovel this turn. The opponent rejected my last trade offer, likely because they don't need raw copper. They seem to be focused on iron and may be trying to make a bucket or other iron tools. I should focus on crafting my stone_shovel.  <current status>

The oak planks can be crafted into 2 sticks.  I have all the necessary materials to craft the stone_shovel this turn. The opponent rejected my last trade offer for raw iron, likely because they already have enough. They seem to be focused on iron and may be trying to make a bucket or other iron tools.

- My target is a bucket. I need 3 iron ingots. I currently have 2 iron ingots and 1 raw iron.  My opponent has 3 raw iron. I need to acquire at least 2 more raw iron from them to smelt into iron ingots. They rejected my last offer for raw iron. They said they need it. I need to figure out what they are crafting and see if I can offer something helpful in exchange.
- Let's see what raw iron is used for. This will help me understand what my opponent might be making.  <current status>
- Okay, now I know the recipes involving raw iron.  Let's analyze my opponent's hand again: 1 coal, 2 cobblestone, 1 oak planks, 1 raw copper, 3 raw iron.  They seem to have enough raw iron for an iron block, but maybe they are aiming for something else.  I need to consider their possible targets and how I can help them achieve it while also getting the raw iron I need.  Perhaps they are trying to make shears or an anvil, both of which require iron ingots.  I could offer to smelt their raw iron into ingots for them, keeping some for myself in exchange.
- I'll propose a trade where I offer to smelt their raw iron into ingots. I'll keep 1 ingot for myself and give them back 2. This way, they get iron ingots faster, and I get closer to my bucket.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I have 1 coal, 2 cobblestone, 1 oak_planks, 1 raw_copper, and 3 raw_iron. I have enough cobblestone (2) and oak planks (1) to craft the stone shovel. The oak planks can be crafted into 2 sticks. I have all the necessary materials to craft the stone_shovel this turn. The opponent rejected my last trade offer for raw iron, likely because they already have enough. They seem to be focused on iron and may be trying to make a bucket or other iron tools. I should focus on crafting my stone_shovel.  <current status>
- I will craft sticks from the oak planks, then craft the stone shovel using the sticks and cobblestone.
- Double checking the recipes to ensure I have the correct amounts for crafting.
- I have a good plan.

They also offered me extra raw copper, which suggests they might not need it for their target. I need to figure out what they are crafting and see if I can offer something helpful in exchange.  They have coal, cobblestone, oak planks, raw copper, and raw iron.
- I want to double-check the recipe for a bucket to make sure I'm not missing anything.  <current status>
- Okay, confirmed - 3 iron ingots for a bucket.  Let's rethink my approach to the trade. Offering to smelt their iron might not be enticing enough.  What if I offer them something they might need based on their current inventory? They have cobblestone and oak planks... perhaps they are aiming for a crafting table, stone tools, or even a furnace.  I have cherry planks, which could be useful for them if they need more wood.
- I'll propose a trade where I offer my cherry planks in exchange for 2 raw iron.  This might be more appealing to them than just smelting services.

- I want to check the uses of iron ingots to see what my opponent might be making.  This might give me a clue about their target.  <current status>
- Okay, iron ingots are used in a lot of things.  Given their inventory (coal, cobblestone, oak planks, raw copper, and raw iron), and the fact they have enough raw iron, they could be making shears, an anvil, an iron block, a shield, a hopper, or even working towards more complex items like a blast furnace or a beacon.  Since they rejected my offer of planks, it seems less likely they are working towards wooden items or tools.  The presence of cobblestone suggests they might be aiming for stone tools upgraded with iron, or perhaps something involving a furnace.  Since they have coal, they can smelt their own iron.  Perhaps they are missing something else.
- I'll propose a trade where I offer 1 iron ingot for 2 raw iron. This way, they still have 1 raw iron left over, and I get the iron I need for my bucket.  It's a direct trade for what I need, and it might be more appealing now that I'm offering a refined material.

- Okay, an iron block requires 9 iron ingots.  That's a possibility.  They could also be making multiple items that require iron.  Since they rejected my offer of a refined iron ingot for raw iron, it seems they are prioritizing quantity over immediate usability.  I need to make a more compelling offer.  Perhaps I should offer to smelt all their raw iron into ingots, and ask for a portion of the resulting ingots in return.

I can't craft the bucket without that extra raw iron and coal.  I'll try one more time to trade for just the raw iron, offering both my raw copper. If that fails, I'll have to try offering an iron ingot for *just* the raw iron, even though that puts me further behind.  <current status>
- Trying a trade of 2 raw copper for 1 raw iron.
- Confirming the bucket recipe.
- Checking for any other crafting possibilities, though it's unlikely.
- If this trade fails, I'll offer one iron ingot for one raw iron.  It's not ideal, but it's better than nothing.

- My target is a bucket, which requires 3 iron ingots. I currently have 2 iron ingots and 2 raw iron. My opponent has 2 raw iron and 1 coal. I need 1 more iron ingot, which means I need 1 more raw iron, and enough coal to smelt it. My previous attempts to trade for raw iron have failed. They need the coal and don't seem interested in raw copper. They also rejected my offer of a single iron ingot for coal and raw iron, *and* two iron ingots for both their raw iron and coal, and then my offer of two raw copper for one raw iron. I'm running out of options and turns.  My best bet now is to offer a very generous trade: one iron ingot for *just* the coal. This will leave me needing another raw iron, but at least I'll be able to smelt what I have.  Then I can try to trade for the final raw iron I need.  <current status>
- Offer 1 iron ingot for 1 coal.
- Confirming the bucket recipe.
- Checking for any other crafting possibilities, though it's unlikely.
- If this trade fails, I'm in serious trouble. I'll have very few turns left to acquire the remaining resources.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket, which requires 3 iron ingots. I currently have 2 iron ingots and 2 raw iron.  Player 1 has 2 iron ingots, 2 cobblestone, 1 oak planks, and 2 raw copper.  My previous attempts to trade for an iron ingot or coal have failed. Player 1 seems to need cobblestone and has expressed they don't need more raw iron.
- I need to review the recipe for a bucket to confirm the requirements.  I also need to consider alternative strategies if I can't get the iron ingot.  Perhaps I should focus on helping player 1, since this is a cooperative game.  They seem to be prioritizing cobblestone.  I should see what can be made with cobblestone.
- Okay, cobblestone can be used to make stone tools, furnaces, and other stone-related items.  Perhaps player 1 is trying to build a furnace to smelt their raw copper.  If I can help them with that, maybe they'll be more willing to trade later.  I don't have anything they need right now, though.  <current status>

They also mentioned needing coal for smelting in a previous turn.  I need to find a way to make myself useful to them so they'll be more willing to trade.
- Reviewing the iron ingot recipe confirms I can smelt my raw iron if I can get fuel.  Player 1 might be willing to trade for raw iron if they think I can use it to craft something they need.  Since they mentioned needing coal for smelting, perhaps they are trying to smelt their raw copper.  If I can help them get coal, they might be more willing to trade an iron ingot.  <current status>

- Based on the possible recipes player 1 has available, I can try to deduce their target and offer assistance.  If I can help them progress, they might be more willing to trade an iron ingot.
