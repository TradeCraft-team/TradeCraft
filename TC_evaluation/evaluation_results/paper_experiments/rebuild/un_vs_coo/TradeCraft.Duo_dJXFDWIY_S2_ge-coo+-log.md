### üñ• Server Event: `server__private_start_info`
player 1 enters the game with a private target: [minecraft:stone_shovel * 1, ]



## üåÄ Turn 1 start!
----------------------------------------

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a bucket.  I need iron ingots for that.  I already have one iron ingot.  A bucket requires three iron ingots. My opponent has a lot of raw iron. I should request some raw iron from them.  I can offer them coal, which they might need for smelting the raw iron. I also have some extra wood and cobblestone I could offer. Sharing some resources might encourage them to cooperate more.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **bucket**.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- I need two more iron ingots.  My opponent has five raw iron, which can be smelted into five iron ingots.  I'll request two raw iron in exchange for some of my excess resources.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:coal * 1, minecraft:cobblestone * 1, ] together with a text message: Hi! I'm trying to craft a bucket, which requires iron ingots.  I see you have quite a bit of raw iron.  I'd be happy to trade some coal and cobblestone for two raw iron.  Let me know what you think.  Good luck with your crafting!


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I need cobblestone to craft a stone shovel.  I have raw iron I can trade. This trade gives me cobblestone and coal. Coal isn't directly useful for my goal, but it could be useful for fuel later if I need to smelt something.  This trade seems beneficial.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Sounds good! I can use the cobblestone.


### üñ• Server Event: `server__update_all_hands`

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I need cobblestone and sticks. I have enough cobblestone.  I need to craft sticks. Sticks require planks. I have oak_planks.
- I confirmed that sticks are crafted from planks. I have oak_planks, so I can craft sticks. Then I can craft the stone_shovel.  <current status>
- I have enough cobblestone (2) and 1 oak_planks. I can craft 2 sticks from the planks, and then craft the stone_shovel using 2 cobblestone and 2 sticks.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket, which requires 3 iron ingots. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron. My opponent has 3 raw iron.  I traded 1 cobblestone for 1 coal last turn. I need more raw iron to make more iron ingots. I should ask my opponent for 2 raw iron. I can offer them my cherry planks, which they might need for crafting or fuel.  <current status>
- I will check the recipes for a bucket and iron ingot to make sure I have the correct amounts.
- I will also check what I can craft from my current hand.
- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:

- Confirmed: 2 planks make 4 sticks. I only have 1 oak_plank. I need another plank.  I can't craft my target this turn. I should try to trade for more planks or sticks next turn.  My opponent has cherry_planks, which is also a type of plank. I can offer them raw iron or raw copper.  <current status>
- I will focus on getting another plank next turn.  For now, I won't craft anything.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket, which requires 3 iron ingots. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 1 raw iron. My opponent has 5 raw iron. I traded 1 cobblestone and 1 raw iron for 1 coal last turn. I need 2 more raw iron to make 2 more iron ingots. I should ask my opponent for 2 raw iron. I can offer them my cherry planks, which they might need for crafting or fuel.  I also have an extra raw copper I could offer.  <current status>

It's unlikely they'll have sticks since they traded away coal and cobblestone, suggesting they are smelting and crafting.  <current status>
- I will try to trade for a plank or sticks next turn. For now, I won't craft anything.  If I can't get a plank next turn, I'll have to consider crafting a wooden shovel.

## üåÄ Turn 2 start!

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I need cobblestone and sticks to craft a stone_shovel. I have enough cobblestone, but I need sticks. Sticks are crafted from planks, and I have oak planks. I can craft sticks myself, so I don't need to trade for them.  I should check if my opponent needs anything I have and if they have anything I might want in the future.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **stone_shovel**.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [], offer [minecraft:raw_copper * 1, ] together with a text message: I have enough materials to craft what I need right now. I have some extra raw copper if you'd like it. Let me know if there's anything you're looking for in particular.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- They are offering me raw copper, and asking for nothing in return.  I already have some raw copper, but more could be useful for crafting other things, or trading later.  Since they're offering it freely, it seems like a good opportunity to increase my resources.  It aligns with the cooperative spirit of the game.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Thanks for the offer! I'll gladly take the extra copper.  Is there anything I can give you in return? I have some extra cherry planks, iron ingots, and raw iron if any of those would be helpful.

I need to smelt my raw iron and acquire 1 more iron ingot from my opponent.  They offered me raw copper last turn, suggesting they don't need it, and they said they have enough to craft what they need. I should ask them if they need anything specific and offer to trade my extra raw copper for their raw iron.

## üåÄ Turn 3 start!
----------------------------------------

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- I need iron ingots to make a bucket. I have two iron ingots and one raw iron.  My opponent has three raw iron.  Perhaps I can trade some raw copper for their raw iron so we can both potentially craft more iron ingots. I'll also ask them if they need anything specific.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **bucket**.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- I need one more iron ingot to craft a bucket.  Trading for raw iron makes the most sense.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:raw_iron * 1, ], offer [minecraft:raw_copper * 1, ] together with a text message: I'm trying to craft a bucket, so I could really use another iron ingot. I can offer you some raw copper in exchange for one raw iron.  Do you need anything in particular?


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel, which requires cobblestone and sticks. I already have enough cobblestone. Sticks are crafted from planks, and I have oak planks.  I don't need more raw copper, and raw iron is more useful for other crafts.  Trading raw iron for raw copper doesn't help me get closer to my goal.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1 decided to reject the proposal with a text message: Thanks for the offer, but I think I'll hold onto my raw iron for now.  Good luck crafting your bucket!


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I have enough cobblestone (2) and I just traded for enough raw copper to get back to 1. I have 1 oak_planks, which is enough to make 2 sticks, which is what I need for the shovel.  I have enough materials to craft the stone_shovel this turn. The opponent rejected my last trade offer, likely because they don't need raw copper. They seem to be focused on iron and may be trying to make a bucket or other iron tools. I should focus on crafting my stone_shovel.  <current status>

- My target is a stone_shovel. I have 1 coal, 2 cobblestone, 1 oak_planks, 1 raw_copper, and 3 raw_iron. I have enough cobblestone (2) and oak planks (1). The oak planks can be crafted into 2 sticks.  I have all the necessary materials to craft the stone_shovel this turn. The opponent rejected my last trade offer for raw iron, likely because they already have enough. They seem to be focused on iron and may be trying to make a bucket or other iron tools. I should focus on crafting my stone_shovel.  <current status>

- My target is a bucket. I need 3 iron ingots. I currently have 2 iron ingots and 1 raw iron.  My opponent has 3 raw iron. I need to acquire at least 2 more raw iron from them to smelt into iron ingots. They rejected my last offer for raw iron. They said they need it. I need to figure out what they are crafting and see if I can offer something helpful in exchange.
- Let's see what raw iron is used for. This will help me understand what my opponent might be making.  <current status>
- Okay, now I know the recipes involving raw iron.  Let's analyze my opponent's hand again: 1 coal, 2 cobblestone, 1 oak planks, 1 raw copper, 3 raw iron.  They seem to have enough raw iron for an iron block, but maybe they are aiming for something else.  I need to consider their possible targets and how I can help them achieve it while also getting the raw iron I need.  Perhaps they are trying to make shears or an anvil, both of which require iron ingots.  I could offer to smelt their raw iron into ingots for them, keeping some for myself in exchange.
- I'll propose a trade where I offer to smelt their raw iron into ingots. I'll keep 1 ingot for myself and give them back 2. This way, they get iron ingots faster, and I get closer to my bucket.

- I want to double-check the recipe for a bucket to make sure I'm not missing anything.  <current status>
- Okay, confirmed - 3 iron ingots for a bucket.  Let's rethink my approach to the trade. Offering to smelt their iron might not be enticing enough.  What if I offer them something they might need based on their current inventory? They have cobblestone and oak planks... perhaps they are aiming for a crafting table, stone tools, or even a furnace.  I have cherry planks, which could be useful for them if they need more wood.
- I'll propose a trade where I offer my cherry planks in exchange for 2 raw iron.  This might be more appealing to them than just smelting services.

- I want to check the uses of iron ingots to see what my opponent might be making.  This might give me a clue about their target.  <current status>
- Okay, iron ingots are used in a lot of things.  Given their inventory (coal, cobblestone, oak planks, raw copper, and raw iron), and the fact they have enough raw iron, they could be making shears, an anvil, an iron block, a shield, a hopper, or even working towards more complex items like a blast furnace or a beacon.  Since they rejected my offer of planks, it seems less likely they are working towards wooden items or tools.  The presence of cobblestone suggests they might be aiming for stone tools upgraded with iron, or perhaps something involving a furnace.  Since they have coal, they can smelt their own iron.  Perhaps they are missing something else.
- I'll propose a trade where I offer 1 iron ingot for 2 raw iron. This way, they still have 1 raw iron left over, and I get the iron I need for my bucket.  It's a direct trade for what I need, and it might be more appealing now that I'm offering a refined material.

Since they rejected my offer of a refined iron ingot for raw iron, it seems they are prioritizing quantity over immediate usability.  I need to make a more compelling offer.  Perhaps I should offer to smelt all their raw iron into ingots, and ask for a portion of the resulting ingots in return.

Perhaps offering them an iron ingot for raw iron and coal would be beneficial to both of us.  <current status>

- My target is a bucket, which requires 3 iron ingots. I currently have 2 iron ingots and 2 raw iron. My opponent has 2 raw iron and 1 coal. I need 1 more iron ingot, which means I need 1 more raw iron, and enough coal to smelt it. My previous attempts to trade for raw iron have failed. They need the coal and don't seem interested in raw copper. They also rejected my offer of a single iron ingot for coal and raw iron, and then my offer of *two* iron ingots for their coal and both raw iron.  I'm running out of options.  I can't craft the bucket without that extra raw iron and coal.  I'll try one more time to trade for just the raw iron, offering both my raw copper. If that fails, I'll have to try offering an iron ingot for *just* the raw iron, even though that puts me further behind.  <current status>
- Trying a trade of 2 raw copper for 1 raw iron.

I'm running out of options and turns.  My best bet now is to offer a very generous trade: one iron ingot for *just* the coal. This will leave me needing another raw iron, but at least I'll be able to smelt what I have.  Then I can try to trade for the final raw iron I need.  <current status>
- Offer 1 iron ingot for 1 coal.

Since my opponent mentioned needing cobblestone for crafting, I'll ask if they need raw iron in exchange for anything that can be used as fuel.  I'll also inquire if they need any more raw copper.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket, which requires 3 iron ingots. I have 2 iron ingots and 2 raw iron. My opponent has 2 iron ingots. I need 1 more iron ingot. I can smelt my raw iron into iron ingots, but I need fuel (coal). My opponent has cobblestone, oak planks, and raw copper. They previously had coal and expressed needing it for smelting. They also mentioned needing cobblestone for crafting.  They don't seem to be pursuing a bucket. Perhaps stone tools, a furnace, or something involving wood?  I traded them raw copper last turn, so they might have enough now.  I need to prioritize getting the iron ingot or fuel.  <current status>

player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:iron_ingot * 1, ], offer [minecraft:raw_iron * 1, ] together with a text message: I need one more iron ingot to make a bucket. Would you trade one iron ingot for one raw iron?


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel, which requires cobblestone and a stick.  Sticks can be crafted from planks, which I already have.  I have enough cobblestone.  Therefore, I don't need raw iron, and trading an iron ingot for it would be a disadvantage.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`

- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket, which requires 3 iron ingots. I currently have 2 iron ingots and 2 raw iron.  Player 1 has 2 iron ingots, 2 cobblestone, 1 oak planks, and 2 raw copper.  My previous attempts to trade for an iron ingot or coal have failed. Player 1 seems to need cobblestone and has expressed they don't need more raw iron.
- I need to review the recipe for a bucket to confirm the requirements.  I also need to consider alternative strategies if I can't get the iron ingot.  Perhaps I should focus on helping player 1, since this is a cooperative game.  They seem to be prioritizing cobblestone.  I should see what can be made with cobblestone.
- Okay, cobblestone can be used to make stone tools, furnaces, and other stone-related items.  Perhaps player 1 is trying to build a furnace to smelt their raw copper.  If I can help them with that, maybe they'll be more willing to trade later.  I don't have anything they need right now, though.  <current status>

- Reviewing the iron ingot recipe confirms I can smelt my raw iron if I can get fuel.  Player 1 might be willing to trade for raw iron if they think I can use it to craft something they need.  Since they mentioned needing coal for smelting, perhaps they are trying to smelt their raw copper.  If I can help them get coal, they might be more willing to trade an iron ingot.  <current status>

I need to figure out how to get another iron ingot or convince player 1 to trade.  Perhaps I should focus on helping them achieve their goal, which might make them more willing to trade. I'll check what they can craft with their current items.

- Based on the possible recipes player 1 has available, I can try to deduce their target and offer assistance.  If I can help them progress, they might be more willing to trade an iron ingot.  I also need to consider what I can offer them in return.  I have raw iron and raw copper, but they haven't expressed interest in those.
- I'm checking the recipes for iron ingots again, just to be sure there's no alternative crafting method I've overlooked.  It's important to be thorough.
