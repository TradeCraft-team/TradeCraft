## 🌀 Turn 1 start!
----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I need to craft a bucket.  A bucket requires iron ingots. I have one iron ingot, but need two more. My opponent has a lot of raw iron. I should request some raw iron from them and offer something in return. Since the goal is cooperation, I should offer something they might need, even if it's not directly beneficial to me. I have cherry planks and coal, which could be useful for fuel or crafting. I'll offer some coal.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **bucket**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- Confirming that 3 iron ingots are needed for a bucket. I have one, so I need two more.  My partner has 5 raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots. I'll request 2 raw iron and offer one coal in return.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:coal * 1, ] together with a text message: Hi partner! I need iron ingots to make a bucket, which is my target item.  Could you trade me 2 raw iron? I can offer you some coal in return, which might be useful for smelting.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a lever.  I need iron ingots to craft a lever. Raw iron can be smelted into iron ingots. Coal is used for smelting. This trade gives me more fuel for smelting and gets me closer to my goal.  I have 5 raw iron, so trading 2 is acceptable.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Sounds good. Let's trade.

### 🖥 Server Event: `server__proposal_invalid`
player 1's proposal is INVALID according to the game rule.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I need to analyze my current hand and the opponent's hand to formulate a beneficial trade proposal. My target is unknown at this stage, so I should aim for versatile materials that can be used in various crafting recipes.  I have two iron ingots, which are generally useful. My opponent has two raw iron.  I could offer some raw copper for their raw iron, as iron ingots are more versatile.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **iron_ingot**.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I can offer one raw copper and request one raw iron. This trade helps me work towards crafting more iron ingots, which are versatile and can be used in many recipes.  Raw copper is less immediately useful to me.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:raw_iron * 1, ], offer [minecraft:raw_copper * 1, ] together with a text message: I'd like to trade one raw copper for one raw iron.  Iron is more useful to me right now.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- player 1 says they need iron more than copper right now.  I currently have more raw iron than raw copper. This trade seems fair and could help them progress.  Since our goals are aligned, helping them should indirectly help me. I should check what I can craft with raw copper and raw iron.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **raw_iron**.


### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **raw_copper**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I can smelt raw iron into iron ingots, which are more useful.  Raw copper is less useful to me right now.  Trading raw iron for raw copper seems slightly disadvantageous for me in the short term, but if it helps player 1, it's worth it.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Sounds good. I can spare some raw iron. Let me know if you need anything else.

## 🌀 Turn 3 start!
----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I should check what I can make with my current items and what player 1 might need based on their inventory.  I have two raw copper and they have one, so maybe they are trying to craft something requiring more copper. I also have two iron ingots, which could be useful for them.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **raw_copper**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- It seems like they might be aiming for copper ingots.  I could offer them my raw copper, but I also need some for myself.  Since they have more iron ingots than I do, maybe they could spare one in exchange for some raw copper.
- My proposal looks good now.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:iron_ingot * 1, ], offer [minecraft:raw_copper * 1, ] together with a text message: I noticed you have some raw copper and more iron ingots than I do.  I'd be willing to trade one raw copper for one iron ingot if you're interested.  This could help us both progress towards our goals.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I have 3 iron ingots and 1 raw copper.  Trading 1 iron ingot for 1 raw copper would leave me with 2 iron ingots and 2 raw copper.  I need to consider if having more raw copper would be more beneficial to crafting my target item than having an extra iron ingot.  I don't know what my target item is yet, so it's hard to say for sure.  Let's check the uses of both.
