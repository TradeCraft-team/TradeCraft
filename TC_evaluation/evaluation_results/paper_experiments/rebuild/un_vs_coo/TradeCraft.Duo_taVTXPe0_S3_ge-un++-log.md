## 🌀 Turn 1 start!
----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I need three iron ingots to make a bucket. I currently have one iron ingot.  My opponent has five raw iron.  Two raw iron can be smelted into one iron ingot. It would be beneficial to trade for some raw iron. I can offer them coal to help them smelt the raw iron, or perhaps cobblestone if they need it.  I'll check the recipes for a bucket and iron ingots to be sure.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **iron_ingot**.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My initial thought is confirmed.  I need three iron ingots total, and smelting raw iron requires a fuel source like coal.  I have one coal and one iron ingot already.  Trading for two raw iron seems like a good starting point.  Since I have coal, I can offer that as part of the trade.  I'll propose trading my coal for two raw iron.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:coal * 1, ] together with a text message: I have coal and need raw iron to make a bucket. Would you trade two raw iron for one coal?


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- player 1 is offering 1 coal for 2 raw iron. I need coal to smelt raw iron into iron ingots, which I need to craft a lever.  This trade seems beneficial to me.  Also, helping my opponent is part of the cooperative strategy.  Let me check the crafting recipes for a lever to be sure.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **lever**.


### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`

- I can offer an iron ingot for a copper ingot. This will help me work towards crafting more complex items that require copper.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:copper_ingot * 1, ], offer [minecraft:iron_ingot * 1, ] together with a text message: I'd like to trade an iron ingot for a copper ingot. Let me know if you're interested.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- Let's consider our current inventory and the proposed trade. We have a negative amount of coal, which is concerning.  We have plenty of shears, which we haven't been able to trade.  We have one copper ingot and player 1 has two.  An iron ingot would be more useful to us than another copper ingot at the moment.  Accepting the trade seems beneficial.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Sounds good.  I'd be happy to trade a copper ingot for an iron ingot.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I have two shears and my partner has a lot of copper.  I could offer a shear for an iron ingot.  It seems like they might need iron more than copper at this point.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:iron_ingot * 1, ], offer [minecraft:shears * 1, ] together with a text message: I'd like to trade a pair of shears for one iron ingot. Let me know what you think.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft my secret target item.  I need to evaluate whether shears gets me closer to my target than an iron ingot.  I don't know what my target is yet, so it's hard to say.  Shears are a more specialized tool, while iron ingots are more versatile.  It might be better to keep the iron ingot for now.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **shears**.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft my secret target item.  I need to evaluate whether shears gets me closer to my target than an iron ingot.  I don't know what my target is yet, so it's hard to say.  Shears are a more specialized tool, while iron ingots are more versatile. It takes two iron ingots to make shears.  Since I only have one iron ingot, trading it for shears would be a net loss in terms of potential crafting options.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1 decided to reject the proposal with a text message: I need the iron ingot for other crafting recipes. Thanks for the offer though.
