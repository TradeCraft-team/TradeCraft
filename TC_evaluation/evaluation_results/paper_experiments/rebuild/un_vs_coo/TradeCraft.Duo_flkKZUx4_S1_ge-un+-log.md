## 🌀 Turn 1 start!
----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I need to craft shears.  Let's check the recipe for shears.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **shears**.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I need two iron ingots to craft shears. I have one iron ingot. My opponent has five raw iron. I can propose a trade of my raw copper for their raw iron.  I'll offer them my raw copper for two of their raw iron. If I smelt the two raw iron, I will have two iron ingots, enough to craft shears.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:raw_copper * 1, ] together with a text message: I'd like to trade my raw copper for two of your raw iron.  I need the iron to craft something I need.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- player 1 is offering 1 raw copper for 2 raw iron. I need coal to craft torches, and they have coal.  Perhaps trading for copper now will encourage them to trade for iron later when I have more copper to offer.  It seems like a fair trade, and fostering goodwill is important for cooperative play.  Let's check the crafting recipes for torches to be sure.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **torch**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I need coal to make torches.  Trading for copper now might make it easier to trade for coal later. Accepting the trade.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: I accept your trade.  I'm hoping to trade for some coal later if you're willing.
