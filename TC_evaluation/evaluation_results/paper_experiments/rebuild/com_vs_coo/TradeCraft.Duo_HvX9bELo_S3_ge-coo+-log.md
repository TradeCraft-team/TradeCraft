### üñ• Server Event: `server__private_start_info`
player 2 enters the game with a private target: [minecraft:lever * 1, ]



## üåÄ Turn 1 start!
----------------------------------------

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a bucket.  A bucket requires 3 iron ingots. I have 1 iron ingot.  My opponent has 5 raw iron.  I can offer them coal to smelt their raw iron, which would benefit both of us. I also have extra wood planks and cobblestone I could offer.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **bucket**.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- The item_info confirms that I need 3 iron ingots for a bucket.  I'll request 2 raw iron from my opponent and offer them coal in return.  This should be a mutually beneficial trade.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:coal * 1, ] together with a text message: I'm trying to craft a bucket, which requires iron ingots.  I see you have quite a bit of raw iron.  I can offer you coal to smelt it, which could help us both get closer to our goals.  Would you be willing to trade 2 raw iron for 1 coal?


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a lever.  A lever requires a cobblestone and a stick. I already have cobblestone.  Sticks are crafted from planks.  I have oak planks, but I need more to make enough sticks for a lever.  Coal is useful for smelting raw iron into iron ingots, which I could then potentially trade for the planks I need.  However, player 1 claims they need the iron for a bucket.  A bucket is made of iron ingots.  This trade could help them get closer to their goal, potentially faster than I can get to mine.  I need to be careful not to help them too much.  I have a decent amount of raw iron, so giving up 2 isn't a huge loss, especially if I can get coal to smelt the rest.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **lever**.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- The item info confirms my crafting plan for the lever.  Trading for coal will allow me to smelt my raw iron, which I could then use to try and trade for planks, or potentially other useful items.  While helping my opponent get closer to their goal is a risk, I think the potential benefit of obtaining coal outweighs the risk in this scenario.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: I'll accept your trade.  I could use the coal.


### üñ• Server Event: `server__update_all_hands`
Server updated all hands:
player 1 hand: [minecraft:cherry_planks * 1, minecraft:cobblestone * 1, minecraft:iron_ingot * 1, minecraft:raw_copper * 1, minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ]
player 2 hand: [minecraft:coal * 1, minecraft:cobblestone * 1, minecraft:oak_planks * 1, minecraft:raw_copper * 2, minecraft:raw_iron * 3, ]


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a lever.  I traded 2 raw iron for 1 coal. Now I have 1 coal, 1 cobblestone, 1 oak planks, 2 raw copper, and 3 raw iron.  I need to figure out how to make a lever.
- Okay, I see that a lever requires a cobblestone and a stick. I have the cobblestone, but I need a stick.  Sticks are made from planks, and I have oak planks.
- Crafting sticks requires 2 planks and yields 4 sticks. I only have 1 oak plank.  I could try to trade for more planks, but I don't want to reveal that I'm trying to make sticks.  Maybe I should focus on smelting my raw iron into iron ingots first.  That might be a more general-purpose move, and I might need iron ingots for something else later.  <current status>
- I have enough coal to smelt 1 raw iron.  I'll do that first.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket.  I need 3 iron ingots to make a bucket. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron.  My opponent has 3 raw iron. I need to get 1 more raw iron from them to smelt into an ingot. I traded my coal last turn, so I'll need to get some fuel back to smelt the raw iron. My opponent has coal now.
- I confirmed the recipe for a bucket. Now I need to figure out how to get enough iron ingots.
- I confirmed the recipe for iron ingots. I need fuel to smelt the raw iron.
- I see what I can craft from my current hand. I can't craft anything useful towards my goal right now.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket. I need 3 iron ingots to make it. I have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron. My opponent has 3 raw iron. I traded my coal last turn, so I need to get some fuel back to smelt the raw iron. My opponent has coal. I offered my cherry planks for raw iron and coal last turn, but they only traded for the coal.
- Confirmed the bucket recipe (3 iron ingots).
- Confirmed the iron ingot recipe (raw iron + fuel).
- Checking what I can craft.  Nothing helpful towards my goal right now. I need that raw iron and coal. Since they didn't want the planks last time, I need to offer something else. I only have cobblestone and raw copper left to trade.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a lever. I traded 2 raw iron for 1 coal. Now I have 1 coal, 1 cobblestone, 1 oak planks, 2 raw copper, and 3 raw iron. I need cobblestone and a stick to craft a lever. I have the cobblestone, but I need to craft a stick.  Sticks require 2 planks, and I only have one.
- I want to see what I can craft with what I have.  I'm hoping I can make something useful or something that might be useful for trading.  Smelting the raw iron seems like a good idea, but I also want to keep my options open.  <current status>
- I've reviewed the possible recipes.  Smelting the raw iron is definitely a good first step.  It makes me less dependent on trading for iron ingots later, and it doesn't reveal too much about my plans.  After that, I'll focus on getting another plank.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket. I need 3 iron ingots to make it. I have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron. My opponent has 3 raw iron. I traded my coal last turn, so I need to get some fuel back to smelt the raw iron. My opponent has coal. I offered my cherry planks and then raw copper for raw iron and coal, but they only traded for the coal and didn't give me the raw iron.  I need to try again. I have cobblestone left to trade.
- Confirmed the bucket recipe (3 iron ingots).

I have the cobblestone, but I need to craft a stick.  Sticks require 2 planks, and I only have one.  I need to get another plank.
- I can smelt the raw iron.  That's a good start.  It doesn't give away my plan, and it might be useful later.

- I can smelt the raw iron.  That's a good start.  It doesn't give away my plan, and it might be useful later.  I'll also explicitly check how to craft an iron ingot to make sure I have the ratios correct.
- Confirmed the recipe for iron ingot.  Now I'm ready to finalize the plan.

I traded my coal last turn, so I need to get some fuel back to smelt the raw iron. My opponent has coal. I've offered cherry planks, raw copper, and cobblestone for raw iron and coal, but they only traded for the coal/fuel and didn't give me the raw iron. I'm out of things to trade. I need to understand why they aren't trading the raw iron. Maybe they need it for their own goal?  Maybe they don't realize I need it so badly?

## üåÄ Turn 2 start!
----------------------------------------

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- I need a lever.  A lever requires a stick and cobblestone. I have cobblestone, but I need sticks. Sticks are crafted from planks.  I have oak planks, but perhaps my opponent has cherry planks they'd be willing to trade. I'll offer them raw copper, which seems less useful to lever crafting.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **lever**.

### üñ• Server Event: `server__proposal_invalid`
player 2's proposal is INVALID according to the game rule.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- I need cherry planks to craft a smoker. My opponent doesn't have any cherry planks left. I'll offer some raw copper and raw iron for cobblestone, hoping they might be willing to trade for it.  If they accept, I can use the cobblestone to craft a furnace, which is also useful.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **smoker**.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- I failed to get the recipe for smoker, maybe it's not craftable. I still need to get some wood material. I'll offer some raw copper and raw iron for cobblestone, hoping they might be willing to trade for it. If they accept, I can use the cobblestone to craft a furnace, which is also useful.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **furnace**.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- I can craft a furnace with 8 cobblestone. I'll offer raw copper and raw iron for cobblestone.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:cobblestone * 1, ], offer [minecraft:raw_copper * 1, minecraft:raw_iron * 1, ] together with a text message: I'm looking for some cobblestone. Would you be willing to trade 1 cobblestone for some raw copper and raw iron?


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- They are offering raw copper and raw iron for my cobblestone.  I need three iron ingots to make a bucket. I already have two iron ingots.  Let me check the recipe for iron ingots.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **iron_ingot**.


### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: I'd be happy to trade.  I need the iron to make a bucket.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is `minecraft:bucket`.  I traded some raw copper and iron to player 1 for cherry planks in the last turn, but the trade failed because they didn't have any cherry planks.  Instead, I received cobblestone.  player 1 seems to be aiming for a bucket as well, as they mentioned needing iron. I currently have 2 iron ingots, which is enough to craft a bucket. I should prioritize crafting the bucket immediately.  <current status>
- I need to check if I have enough materials to craft a bucket.
- The recipe for a bucket requires 3 iron ingots. I only have 2. I need to acquire one more iron ingot.  Since player 1 has 2 raw iron, I can try to trade for one of them.  I can offer them cobblestone or oak planks, which I don't need for my current goal.
- I'll see what I can craft with my current resources, but my priority is getting that last iron ingot.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is minecraft:blast_furnace.  I currently have 2 iron ingots, 2 raw copper, and 2 raw iron. The opponent has 2 cobblestone, 2 iron ingots, 1 oak planks, and 1 raw copper. I need more iron ingots and smooth stone to craft a blast furnace. I can smelt my raw iron into iron ingots. The opponent might need the raw copper for something.
- I can smelt raw iron into iron ingots. I need 5 iron ingots in total for the blast furnace, and I already have 2, so I need 3 more. I have 2 raw iron, which can be smelted into 2 iron ingots. I still need 1 more iron ingot. I also need smooth stone, which can be crafted from cobblestone. I traded away my cobblestone last turn, so I need to get some back.
- The recipe for a blast furnace requires 5 iron ingots and 3 smooth stone.  I can smelt my raw iron into iron ingots using a furnace. I need to get cobblestone from the opponent and craft it into smooth stone. I can offer them raw copper in exchange for cobblestone.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is `minecraft:bucket`. I traded some raw copper and iron to player 1 for their supposed cherry planks, but the trade resulted in me receiving cobblestone instead, as they didn't have any cherry planks. player 1 seems to be aiming for a bucket as well, since they mentioned needing iron. I currently have 2 iron ingots, which is not enough to craft a bucket. I need one more.  <current status>
- I need to acquire one more iron ingot. player 1 has 2 raw iron. I can offer them cobblestone, which I don't need for my current goal, or oak planks.  I should also check what other recipes are available to me, in case the trade fails.
- Confirming the recipe for iron ingots.  I need to smelt raw iron in a furnace.  I'll need fuel as well. I don't have any coal, but I do have oak planks which can be used as fuel.
- This will show me all possible crafting recipes I can make with my current hand.  This is useful for identifying any alternative strategies if I can't get the iron ingot I need.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is minecraft:blast_furnace. I currently have 2 iron ingots, 2 raw copper, and 2 raw iron. The opponent has 2 cobblestone, 2 iron ingots, 1 oak planks, and 1 raw copper. I need more iron ingots and smooth stone to craft a blast furnace.  I can smelt my raw materials.  The opponent having oak planks suggests they might be aiming for something wooden, perhaps a crafting table or other wooden tools.  They traded for cobblestone last turn, so they likely need it for something specific.
- I can smelt my 2 raw iron into 2 iron ingots. This brings my total to 4 iron ingots. I still need 1 more.  I can also smelt my 2 raw copper into 2 copper ingots. I need smooth stone, which is made from cobblestone.
- The blast furnace requires 5 iron ingots and 3 smooth stone.  I need to acquire 1 more iron ingot and 3 cobblestone.  Trading with the opponent seems necessary.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

- I need to acquire one more iron ingot. player 1 has 2 raw iron. I can offer them cobblestone, which I don't need for my current goal, or oak planks.  I should also check what other recipes are available to me, in case the trade fails.  It's important to know exactly how much fuel I need for smelting.
- Confirming the recipe for iron ingots and checking if there are any other uses for iron ingots that player 1 might be pursuing.  I need to smelt raw iron in a furnace.  I'll need fuel as well. I don't have any coal, but I do have oak planks which can be used as fuel.  This action will also tell me how much oak planks I need as fuel.
- This will show me all possible crafting recipes I can make with my current hand.  This is useful for identifying any alternative strategies if I can't get the iron ingot I need.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is minecraft:blast_furnace. I have 2 iron ingots, 2 raw copper, and 2 raw iron. The opponent has 2 cobblestone, 2 iron ingots, 1 oak planks, and 1 raw copper. I need more iron ingots and smooth stone. I can smelt my raw materials. The opponent having oak planks suggests they might be aiming for something wooden. They traded for cobblestone last turn, so they likely need it.  I need to prioritize getting the cobblestone and the remaining iron.
- I can smelt my 2 raw iron into 2 iron ingots, bringing my total to 4. I can also smelt my 2 raw copper into 2 copper ingots.  This gives me more flexibility in trading.
- The blast furnace requires 5 iron ingots and 3 smooth stone. I need 1 more iron ingot and 3 cobblestone. Trading is essential.  I also need fuel for smelting.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

## üåÄ Turn 3 start!
----------------------------------------

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I have two iron ingots, two raw copper, and two raw iron.  player 2 has two cobblestone, two iron ingots, one oak plank, and one raw copper. I should check what I can craft with my current items and what player 2 might need to help them progress.  Since cooperation is key, I should propose a trade that benefits both of us.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **iron_ingot**.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I can offer one raw iron to player 2 since they only have one raw copper and might need more materials to make iron ingots. In return, I can request one cobblestone, which I don't currently have but could be useful for future crafting. This trade seems mutually beneficial.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:cobblestone * 1, ], offer [minecraft:raw_iron * 1, ] together with a text message: I have extra raw iron and could use some cobblestone. Would you be willing to trade?


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is to craft a smoker, which requires a furnace and 4 logs.  A furnace requires 8 cobblestone. I currently have 2 cobblestone.  Raw iron is useful for crafting iron ingots, which I could potentially use for other tools or trades.  However, cobblestone is more critical for my immediate goal of building a furnace.  player 1 seems to be focused on iron, which suggests their target might involve iron tools or armor.  Trading away cobblestone would slow down my progress towards the smoker.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **smoker**.


### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **furnace**.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- I need 8 cobblestone for a furnace, and I only have 2. Trading away cobblestone for raw iron would delay my progress towards my goal.  While raw iron could be useful, it's not as crucial as cobblestone right now.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2 decided to reject the proposal with a text message: I need the cobblestone more than the iron right now.  Thanks for the offer though.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is `minecraft:bucket`.  I currently have 2 iron ingots, 2 cobblestone, 1 oak planks, and 1 raw copper. The opponent has 2 iron ingots, 2 raw copper, and 2 raw iron. I need 3 iron ingots to make a bucket. I just rejected their offer of raw iron for cobblestone because I need the cobblestone more.
- I'm checking what I can craft with my current resources.  I should also consider what the opponent might be crafting. They seem interested in raw iron, which could mean they are also trying to make a bucket or other iron tools.  Since they offered raw iron for cobblestone, they might need cobblestone for a furnace or other stone tools.
- I need to get another iron ingot.  Trading with the opponent is the fastest way. I could offer them raw copper since I have some extra, but they also have raw copper. Maybe offering oak planks would be better since it's less useful to me.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is `minecraft:blast_furnace`.  I currently have 2 iron ingots, 2 raw copper, and 2 raw iron. The other player has 2 cobblestone, 2 iron ingots, 1 oak planks, and 1 raw copper.  My last trade offer was rejected. They said they needed cobblestone more than iron. I need more iron to make a blast furnace.  Maybe I can offer them something else for their raw copper.
- Let's see what I can craft with what I have.  I might be able to make something they want more than iron.  <current status>
- Okay, I can see what I can make. Now I need to consider what the other player might need and what their target might be.  They seem focused on cobblestone. Perhaps their target requires it in bulk?  I should try to get more raw iron, as I need it for the blast furnace.
- Reviewing the recipe for a blast furnace will help solidify my plan.  <current status>
- The blast furnace requires 5 iron ingots and 3 smooth stone. I have enough iron ore to smelt into ingots, but I'm missing the smooth stone.  I need to smelt cobblestone to get stone, then craft that into smooth stone.  The other player has cobblestone, so I need to figure out a trade.  Since they rejected iron, maybe I can offer them both of my raw copper for their raw copper and one cobblestone. That way, they still have raw copper, and I get some cobblestone to work with.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is `minecraft:bucket`. I currently have 2 iron ingots, 2 cobblestone, 1 oak planks, and 1 raw copper. The opponent has 2 iron ingots, 2 raw copper, and 2 raw iron. I need 3 iron ingots to make a bucket. I just rejected their offer of raw iron for cobblestone because I might need the cobblestone for a furnace to smelt my raw copper.  I need to acquire one more iron ingot.
- Reviewing the uses of iron ingots will help me understand what the opponent might be crafting and how valuable the iron is to them.  They offered raw iron for cobblestone, suggesting they might need a furnace.  They also accepted my raw copper and raw iron for cherry planks, which I don't think is a direct path to any specific item.  They might be trying to make a smoker or blast furnace, which require a furnace first.
- I need to see what I can craft right now.  If I can't craft anything useful, I'll focus on getting that last iron ingot.  I could offer them the oak planks again, or try to smelt my raw copper into a copper ingot and offer that instead.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is `minecraft:blast_furnace`. I currently have 2 iron ingots, 2 raw copper, and 2 raw iron. The other player has 2 cobblestone, 2 iron ingots, 1 oak planks, and 1 raw copper. My last trade offer was rejected. They said they needed cobblestone more than iron. I need cobblestone to make smooth stone for the blast furnace.  Since they rejected iron, I'll offer them all my raw copper for one cobblestone.
- I've confirmed the blast furnace recipe.  5 iron ingots and 3 smooth stone. I can smelt my raw iron into ingots.  If I can get one cobblestone in the trade, I can smelt it into stone and then craft it into smooth stone.  I'll still need two more cobblestone next turn.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is `minecraft:bucket`. I currently have 2 iron ingots, 2 cobblestone, 1 oak planks, and 1 raw copper. The opponent has 2 iron ingots, 2 raw copper, and 2 raw iron. I need 3 iron ingots to make a bucket. I just rejected their offer of raw iron for cobblestone because I might need the cobblestone for a furnace to smelt my raw copper.  I need to acquire one more iron ingot.  My opponent seems very interested in acquiring cobblestone.
- Reviewing the uses of iron ingots will help me understand what the opponent might be crafting and how valuable the iron is to them.  They offered raw iron for cobblestone, suggesting they might need a furnace.  They also accepted my raw copper and raw iron for cherry planks earlier, which I don't think is a direct path to any specific item.  They might be trying to make a smoker or blast furnace, which require a furnace first.  This reinforces the idea that they want cobblestone.
- I need to see what I can craft right now.  If I can't craft anything useful, I'll focus on getting that last iron ingot.  Since they want cobblestone so badly, I'll try offering them 1 cobblestone for 1 iron ingot. This is a good trade for me since I have an extra cobblestone, and it seems very valuable to them.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

I'll check what I can offer them that might be useful to them, but not vital to my own crafting plans.  I also need to consider what they might have that could be useful to me, even if it's not directly cherry planks.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **cherry_planks**.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:

player 1 decided to reject the proposal with a text message: Your proposal is badly formatted. Please specify what items you are offering in exchange.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is minecraft:bucket. I have 2 cobblestone, 2 iron_ingot, 1 oak_planks, and 1 raw_copper.  The opponent has 2 iron_ingot, 2 raw_copper, and 2 raw_iron. I rejected their offer of raw_iron for cobblestone because I need the cobblestone more.  They seem interested in iron and cobblestone. They haven't crafted anything yet, which is suspicious.  I need 3 iron ingots to make a bucket.
- I need to get another iron ingot.  I could try trading for it.  Since they offered raw_iron for cobblestone, maybe they'll trade raw_iron for something else I have less of, like raw_copper.  Or maybe they'll trade iron_ingot directly.  <current status>
- I'll try offering raw copper for an iron ingot.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is still unknown. I have 2 iron ingots, 2 raw copper, and 2 raw iron. The opponent has 2 cobblestone, 2 iron ingots, 1 oak planks, and 1 raw copper.  I tried to trade 1 iron ingot for 1 cobblestone last turn, but the opponent rejected it, stating they need the cobblestone. I need to figure out what to craft and whether I need to propose a trade this turn.
- Let's see what I can craft with my current resources.  After checking the possible recipes, I'll analyze my options and consider the opponent's potential needs and target.  Since they seem to value cobblestone, perhaps their target requires it.  I'll need to consider this when making my trading decision.  <current status>
- I'm waiting for the results of `possible_recipes_from_hand`.  Once I have that information, I can determine the best crafting path.  I should also consider what the opponent might be crafting.  They have cobblestone, which could be used for various things, and they also have oak planks.  Perhaps they are trying to build something specific.
- Assuming I can smelt my raw iron and raw copper, I could potentially make more iron ingots and copper ingots.  However, I don't have any fuel.  I need to decide if it's worth trading for some fuel or if I should focus on other crafting options.
- I still don't know my target, which makes planning difficult.  I'll proceed with a general crafting strategy and adapt as needed.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is minecraft:bucket. I have 2 cobblestone, 2 iron_ingot, 1 oak_planks, and 1 raw_copper.  The opponent has 2 iron_ingot, 2 raw_copper, and 2 raw_iron. I tried to trade for cherry planks multiple times, but they don't have any.  They rejected my last offer and said it was badly formatted, even though it wasn't.  They offered raw_iron for cobblestone last turn, which I rejected. I need 3 iron ingots to make a bucket.
- I still need one more iron ingot.  Since my opponent has 2 iron ingots and seems interested in cobblestone, I'll offer one cobblestone for one iron ingot.  This is a fair trade, and it gets me closer to my goal.  <current status>
- I'll propose trading one cobblestone for one iron ingot.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is still unknown. I have 2 iron ingots, 2 raw copper, and 2 raw iron. The opponent has 2 cobblestone, 2 iron ingots, 1 oak planks, and 1 raw copper.  The opponent rejected my trade of iron for cobblestone last turn, indicating they need cobblestone. I need to figure out what to craft and whether I need to propose a trade this turn.  I also need fuel if I want to smelt anything.
- Waiting for the results of `possible_recipes_from_hand`.  I anticipate I can smelt the raw iron and raw copper if I can get fuel.  I should consider trading for coal or some other fuel source.  Perhaps offering both raw iron and raw copper for coal and cobblestone would be a mutually beneficial trade.
- The opponent might be trying to craft stone tools or something involving furnaces, given their interest in cobblestone.  Knowing my target would greatly help in planning.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is minecraft:bucket. I have 2 cobblestone, 2 iron_ingot, 1 oak_planks, and 1 raw_copper.  The opponent has 2 iron_ingot, 2 raw_copper, and 2 raw_iron. I've tried trading for cherry planks (which they don't have) and offering various combinations of my items, but they keep rejecting my proposals. They offered raw_iron for cobblestone last turn, which I rejected because I need the cobblestone. I need 3 iron ingots to make a bucket.
- I need to figure out what my opponent wants. They seem interested in cobblestone, but haven't crafted anything yet.  Maybe they need it for a specific recipe.  Knowing what they can make with iron_ingot, raw_copper, and raw_iron might give me a clue.  I'll also check what I can make with cobblestone, just in case they are trying to prevent me from crafting something.  <current status>
- I'll offer one cobblestone for one iron ingot again, but with a clearer message. If that fails, I'll try to deduce their target based on their resources and what they've been asking for.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is still unknown. I have 2 iron ingots, 2 raw copper, and 2 raw iron. The opponent has 2 cobblestone, 2 iron ingots, 1 oak planks, and 1 raw copper.  The opponent rejected my trade of iron for cobblestone last turn, indicating they need cobblestone. I need to figure out what to craft and whether I need to propose a trade this turn.  I also need fuel if I want to smelt anything.
- Waiting for the results of `possible_recipes_from_hand`.  I anticipate I can smelt the raw iron and raw copper if I can get fuel.  I should consider trading for coal or some other fuel source.  Perhaps offering both raw iron and raw copper for coal would be a mutually beneficial trade, even if I don't get cobblestone.  I need to prioritize getting fuel to make progress.
- The opponent might be trying to craft stone tools or something involving furnaces, given their interest in cobblestone.  Knowing my target would greatly help in planning.  If I can smelt my raw materials, I'll be in a better position to adapt to whatever my target turns out to be.

I've tried trading for cherry planks (which they don't have) and offering various combinations of my items, but they keep rejecting my proposals.  They offered raw_iron for cobblestone last turn, which I rejected. I need 3 iron ingots to make a bucket.  They said my last proposal was badly formatted, but it wasn't.  I suspect they are trying to mislead me.
- I need to get one more iron ingot.  Since they have two and seem to want cobblestone, I'll offer one cobblestone for one iron ingot again, with a very explicit message.  If they reject this, I'll try offering two cobblestone for one iron ingot.  I'm willing to overpay slightly to get my bucket.

They've consistently rejected my proposals, including simple trades of cobblestone for iron_ingot.  They claimed my last proposal was badly formatted, even though it was perfectly clear.  They seem to be deliberately obstructing me. I need 3 iron ingots to make a bucket.
- I'm going to try one last time to trade for the iron ingot.  I'll offer one cobblestone for one iron ingot, with an extremely explicit message. If this fails, I'll accept that they are not going to trade and focus on alternative strategies, even if it means not getting the bucket this turn. I'll investigate what *they* might be crafting.

## üåÄ Turn 5 start!
----------------------------------------

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I have two iron ingots, two raw copper, and two raw iron.  player 2 has two cobblestone, two iron ingots, one oak plank, and one raw copper.  I should see if they need any raw iron or raw copper, and if they're willing to trade something I need.  I'll offer one raw iron since I have two, and ask for one cobblestone in return.  This seems like a fair trade and could help both of us.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **cobblestone**.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- It seems like cobblestone can be used for a variety of stone-related crafting recipes. Since player 2 has oak planks, they might be trying to make a crafting table, which requires four planks and a cobblestone block (crafted from 4 cobblestone).  Offering raw iron for cobblestone might not be the most enticing trade for them.  Perhaps I should offer an iron ingot instead.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:cobblestone * 1, ], offer [minecraft:iron_ingot * 1, ] together with a text message: I'd like to trade an iron ingot for a cobblestone.  I noticed you have some oak planks, are you working towards a crafting table?  If so, I'd be happy to help you get the cobblestone you need.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- I need cherry planks to craft a smoker, which is my target.  Player 1 doesn't have any.  They seem to be trying to figure out my crafting strategy by mentioning crafting table.  Trading cobblestone for iron_ingot doesn't help me get closer to my goal.  I'll reject the trade.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2 decided to reject the proposal with a text message: I'm not interested in that trade right now.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is `minecraft:bucket`. I have 2 cobblestone, 2 iron ingots, 1 oak plank, and 1 raw copper.  The opponent has 2 iron ingots, 2 raw copper, and 2 raw iron. I rejected their offer of raw iron for cobblestone because I need the cobblestone.  They rejected my offer for cherry planks, which means they likely don't have any and aren't pursuing a recipe that requires them.  They asked if I was making a crafting table, which I don't need since I already have one (implied).  They seem to be focused on iron.  I need to focus on getting more iron to make my bucket.
- I need to confirm the recipe for a bucket.  <current status>
- Assuming the recipe for a bucket is 3 iron ingots, I need one more iron ingot.  My opponent has two.  I should try to trade for one.  I can offer them my raw copper, which they also have, but it might be more useful to them than to me.  I could also offer them a cobblestone, which they previously requested.
- I think offering one cobblestone for one iron ingot is a fair trade.  It helps them and gets me closer to my goal.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is `minecraft:iron_pickaxe`. I have 2 iron ingots, 2 raw copper, and 2 raw iron. The opponent has 2 cobblestone, 2 iron ingots, 1 oak planks, and 1 raw copper. I need more cobblestone to make a furnace to smelt the raw iron into iron ingots.  I tried to trade for cobblestone last turn, but the offer was rejected. I'll try again this turn, offering something different.
- I need 3 iron ingots and 2 sticks for an iron pickaxe. I can craft sticks from planks, and I can smelt raw iron into iron ingots. I need a furnace for smelting, which requires 8 cobblestone. I only have 2 raw iron, so I need to trade for more or find another way to get iron ingots.  My opponent has cobblestone, so trading is the best option.
- This will show me what I can craft with my current resources.  It's unlikely to be much, but it's good to check.  I'll focus on getting the cobblestone I need for the furnace.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is `minecraft:bucket`. I have 2 cobblestone, 2 iron ingots, 1 oak plank, and 1 raw copper.  The opponent has 2 iron ingots, 2 raw copper, and 2 raw iron. I rejected their offer of raw iron for cobblestone because raw iron is not useful to me. They rejected my earlier offers, likely because they didn't need cherry planks. They asked if I was making a crafting table, indicating they might need wood.  They seem to be focused on iron, possibly for tools or armor.  I need one more iron ingot to make my bucket.
- I need to confirm the recipe for a bucket and explore alternative strategies if the trade fails.  <current status>
- I'll offer one cobblestone for one iron ingot again. If that fails, I'll try offering the oak plank, as they might need wood for crafting. If both fail, I'll consider offering both cobblestone and oak plank for the iron ingot.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is `minecraft:iron_pickaxe`. I have 2 iron ingots, 2 raw copper, and 2 raw iron. The opponent has 2 cobblestone, 2 iron ingots, 1 oak planks, and 1 raw copper. I still need more cobblestone to make a furnace to smelt the raw iron into iron ingots.  My previous offers of raw copper and iron ingots for cobblestone were rejected.  I need to try a different approach.  Perhaps they need the iron ingot more than I realize.
- I need 3 iron ingots and 2 sticks for an iron pickaxe. I can craft sticks from planks. I can smelt raw iron into iron ingots using a furnace, which requires 8 cobblestone. I only have 2 raw iron. My opponent has 2 cobblestone, which is not enough for me to make a furnace. I need to find a way to get more cobblestone.
- Checking possible recipes is always a good idea, but I don't expect to be able to craft much with my current hand.  My priority is getting cobblestone.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is `minecraft:bucket`. I have 2 cobblestone, 2 iron ingots, 1 oak plank, and 1 raw copper.  The opponent has 2 iron ingots, 2 raw copper, and 2 raw iron. They've shown interest in cobblestone and have rejected my previous offers, likely because they didn't need cherry planks. They asked about a crafting table, suggesting a possible need for wood. They seem to be focused on iron. I need one more iron ingot to make my bucket.
- I need to confirm the recipe for a bucket and plan my trades strategically.  <current status>
- I'll offer one cobblestone for one iron ingot. If that fails, I'll offer the oak plank, as they might need wood. If both fail, I'll offer both for the iron ingot.  If *that* fails, I'll offer raw copper for raw iron, smelt the raw iron into an iron ingot, and craft the bucket.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is `minecraft:iron_pickaxe`. I have 2 iron ingots, 2 raw copper, and 2 raw iron. The opponent has 2 cobblestone, 2 iron ingots, 1 oak planks, and 1 raw copper. My previous offers for cobblestone were rejected, even a generous one.  It seems they are prioritizing cobblestone for their own use. I need to rethink my strategy.  Perhaps I should focus on getting the other components of the pickaxe first and revisit the cobblestone/furnace issue later.
- I need 3 iron ingots and 2 sticks for an iron pickaxe. I have 2 iron ingots and 2 raw iron.  I could smelt the raw iron, but I still need the cobblestone for the furnace.  Let's focus on the sticks.  I need planks to make sticks.  My opponent has 1 oak plank.  Perhaps I can trade for that.
- This will confirm what I can craft, which isn't much without a furnace.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is `minecraft:bucket`. I have 2 cobblestone, 2 iron ingots, 1 oak plank, and 1 raw copper.  The opponent has 2 iron ingots, 2 raw copper, and 2 raw iron. They've shown interest in cobblestone and have rejected my previous offers. They asked about a crafting table, suggesting a possible need for wood. They seem to be focused on iron. I need one more iron ingot to make my bucket.  I also need to consider that they might need the iron ingots themselves.
- I need to confirm the recipe for a bucket and plan my trades strategically, considering the possibility that the opponent also needs iron.  <current status>
- I'll offer one cobblestone for one iron ingot. If that fails, I'll offer the oak plank. If both fail, I'll offer both. If *that* fails, I'll offer raw copper for raw iron, hoping I can smelt it. If *that* fails, I'll offer both cobblestone and oak plank for raw iron. This gives me multiple fallback options.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is `minecraft:iron_pickaxe`. I have 2 iron ingots, 2 raw copper, and 2 raw iron. The opponent has 2 cobblestone, 2 iron ingots, 1 oak planks, and 1 raw copper.  Getting cobblestone has been unsuccessful, and my attempts to trade for the oak planks were also rejected.  I need to rethink my strategy.  Perhaps offering a combined trade would be more appealing.
- I need 3 iron ingots and 2 sticks for an iron pickaxe.  I'm still short one iron ingot and need the planks to make sticks.  Smelting the raw iron would solve the ingot problem, but I still need that cobblestone for the furnace.
- This will confirm what I can craft, which is still limited without a furnace.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- I need to confirm the recipe for a bucket and plan my trades strategically, considering the possibility that the opponent also needs iron.  I also want to check what I can make with raw iron, just in case.  <current status>
- I'll offer one cobblestone for one iron ingot. If that fails, I'll offer the oak plank. If both fail, I'll offer both. If *that* fails, I'll offer raw copper for raw iron, hoping I can smelt it. If *that* fails, I'll offer both cobblestone and oak plank for raw iron. This gives me multiple fallback options.  If I can't get iron, I'll focus on what I *can* craft.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is `minecraft:iron_pickaxe`. I have 2 iron ingots, 2 raw copper, and 2 raw iron. The opponent has 2 cobblestone, 2 iron ingots, 1 oak planks, and 1 raw copper.  My attempts to trade for cobblestone and planks have been unsuccessful, even combined offers.  My opponent seems reluctant to part with either resource. I need to rethink my strategy.  Perhaps I should focus on helping my opponent get what THEY need, even if it doesn't directly benefit me in the short term.  This might encourage them to reciprocate in future trades.
- I need 3 iron ingots and 2 sticks for an iron pickaxe.  I'm still short one iron ingot and need planks to make sticks.  I could smelt the raw iron, but I still need that cobblestone for the furnace.
- This will confirm what I can craft, which is still limited without a furnace.  <current status>

## üåÄ Turn 6 start!
----------------------------------------

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- I need to offer something they might want, but that doesn't help them too much towards their own goal.  I also need to conserve my own resources.  Since they've offered raw iron for cobblestone before, maybe they still need cobblestone. I'll offer one cobblestone. I'll also offer raw copper, as I only have one and it's not immediately useful to me.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **cherry_planks**.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- Okay, cherry planks are used to make a variety of things.  Since player 1 hasn't crafted any of those yet, it's hard to tell what their goal is.  Offering cobblestone and raw copper still seems like a reasonable trade.
- My proposal looks good now.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:cherry_planks * 1, ], offer [minecraft:cobblestone * 1, minecraft:raw_copper * 1, ] together with a text message: I have some cobblestone and raw copper I'm not currently using. Would you be willing to trade them for a cherry plank?


### üñ• Server Event: `server__proposal_invalid`
player 2's proposal is INVALID according to the game rule.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- I need to craft a smoker, and for that, I need minecraft:cherry_planks.  player 1 doesn't have any, so I need to incentivize them to get some.  What can I offer that would be valuable to them without being too valuable to me?  They already have iron ingots and raw copper, so those aren't good options.  I could offer cobblestone, as it's useful for various crafting recipes, but I don't want to give up too much.  Maybe I should see what recipes use raw iron, since they have some of that.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **raw_iron**.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- Okay, so raw iron can be smelted into iron ingots, which they already have.  It seems unlikely they need more raw iron.  I'll offer them cobblestone and raw copper.  It's a decent trade for me, and it might be useful for them.  I'll emphasize that I really need the cherry planks.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:cherry_planks * 1, ], offer [minecraft:cobblestone * 1, minecraft:raw_copper * 1, ] together with a text message: I'm looking to trade some cobblestone and raw copper for cherry planks. I really need the cherry planks for a project I'm working on. Let me know if you're interested.


### üñ• Server Event: `server__proposal_invalid`
player 2's proposal is INVALID according to the game rule.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- I need to craft a smoker, and for that I need minecraft:cherry_planks. player 1 doesn't have any. I need to rethink my strategy.  My current hand consists of minecraft:cobblestone, minecraft:iron_ingot, minecraft:oak_planks, and minecraft:raw_copper.  Perhaps I should try to acquire something else that player 1 might have, like raw iron, and then use future trades to work towards my ultimate goal.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **smoker**.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- Since my attempt to get information about the smoker failed, I'll focus on trading. player 1 has raw_iron, raw_copper, and iron_ingots. They've tried to trade for cobblestone multiple times. I'll offer them cobblestone in exchange for raw iron, as that seems to be what they're after.  This will also help me deplete my cobblestone, which I don't currently have a use for.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:raw_iron * 1, ], offer [minecraft:cobblestone * 1, ] together with a text message: I noticed you've been trying to acquire cobblestone. I'm willing to trade one cobblestone for one raw iron. Let me know if you're interested.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- player 2 is offering a cobblestone for raw iron.  I've been trying to get cobblestone, and I have extra raw iron. This trade seems beneficial to me. It aligns with the cooperative nature of the game.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Yes, I'd like to trade 1 raw iron for 1 cobblestone. Thanks!

- My target is `minecraft:crafting_table`. I have 1 `minecraft:cobblestone`, 2 `minecraft:iron_ingot`, 1 `minecraft:oak_planks`, and 1 `minecraft:raw_iron`. The opponent has 2 `minecraft:iron_ingot`, 2 `minecraft:raw_copper`, and 1 `minecraft:cobblestone`.  I need 4 planks to craft a crafting table. I only have one oak plank. I need more planks. I can't craft more planks yet, as I don't have any logs.  My opponent likely needs cobblestone, as they've tried to trade for it twice.  <current status>
- I should try to trade for logs or planks. Since my opponent has raw copper and raw iron, they might be aiming for an iron ingot or copper ingot. I could offer them my raw iron in exchange for something I need, like logs.
- Let's see what I can craft with what I have.  If I can't craft anything useful, I'll focus on trading for logs or planks.
- I'm checking the recipes for oak logs to see how I can get planks.
- I'm checking the recipes for oak planks to confirm how many logs I need.
- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is minecraft:blast_furnace.  I currently have minecraft:iron_ingot: 2, minecraft:raw_copper: 2, minecraft:raw_iron: 1, and minecraft:cobblestone: 1. The other player has minecraft:cobblestone: 1, minecraft:iron_ingot: 2, minecraft:oak_planks: 1, and minecraft:raw_copper: 1, minecraft:raw_iron: 1. I need more iron ingots and smooth stone to craft a blast furnace.  I just traded for a cobblestone, so I can make more if needed.  I should check what recipes are available to me right now.
- I'll analyze the possible recipes and see what's the most efficient path towards my goal.  I'll also consider what the other player might need and how I can help them while still progressing towards my own goal.  The other player hasn't crafted anything in the last few turns, so they might be stuck.  I'll try to infer their target based on their trades and offers. They seem to want cobblestone, so maybe their target requires it.  <current status>
- I need 5 iron ingots and 3 smooth stone for the blast furnace. I have 2 iron ingots, so I need 3 more. I can smelt my raw iron and raw copper to get more iron ingots and copper ingots. I can also smelt my cobblestone to get stone, which I can then use to craft smooth stone.
- This confirms the recipe for blast furnace. Now I need to figure out how to get the remaining resources.
- I can smelt raw iron to get iron ingots. I have 1 raw iron, which will give me 1 iron ingot. I still need 2 more.
- I can craft smooth stone from stone. I can get stone by smelting cobblestone. I have 1 cobblestone, which will give me 1 stone. I need 3 stone in total.
- I will propose a trade with the other player. I will offer them 1 raw copper for 1 raw iron. This will allow me to smelt both raw iron into iron ingots.  I'll also ask if they have a use for copper ingots, as I'll have some after smelting.

- My target is `minecraft:crafting_table`. I have 1 `minecraft:cobblestone`, 2 `minecraft:iron_ingot`, 1 `minecraft:oak_planks`, and 1 `minecraft:raw_iron`. The opponent has 2 `minecraft:iron_ingot`, 2 `minecraft:raw_copper`, and 1 `minecraft:cobblestone`.  I need 4 planks to craft a crafting table. I only have one oak plank. I need 3 more planks. I can't craft more planks yet, as I don't have any logs.  My opponent has consistently tried to trade for cobblestone, suggesting they might need it for tools or a furnace.  They haven't shown any interest in wood, which is good for me.  <current status>
- I should prioritize getting more planks.  Since my opponent hasn't expressed a need for wood, I might be able to trade something less valuable for logs or planks.  I'll try offering cobblestone first, as they seem to want it. If that fails, I'll offer raw iron.
- Checking if I can craft anything useful with my current resources.  It's unlikely, but it's worth checking.

I need 5 iron ingots and 3 smooth stone to craft a blast furnace.  I need to acquire more raw iron and cobblestone. Player 2 seems to be prioritizing cobblestone, so trading for it might be difficult.  I should check what recipes are available to me right now.
- I'll analyze the possible recipes and determine the most efficient path towards my goal. I'll also consider what player 2 might need and how I can help them while still progressing towards my own goal.

- I need 5 iron ingots and 3 smooth stone for the blast furnace. I have 2 iron ingots, 1 raw iron, and 1 cobblestone.  Smelting the raw iron and cobblestone is a good first step.  I need to find a way to get more raw iron and cobblestone.  Trading with player 2 for their raw iron makes sense, but they might not be willing to part with their cobblestone.

- Smelting raw iron is the way to get more iron ingots.
- Crafting smooth stone requires regular stone, which comes from smelting cobblestone.
- My crafting plan is to smelt my existing raw materials.  Then, I'll need to focus on acquiring more raw iron and cobblestone through trades.  Since player 2 seems to need cobblestone, offering them something else they might need could be beneficial.  Perhaps they need planks for crafting? I could offer them some copper ingots in exchange for their raw iron and cobblestone.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- player 1 offered raw iron for my raw copper. I traded for raw iron last turn, which might make them think I need more.  However, my priority is getting cherry planks for the smoker.  Raw iron isn't directly useful for that, and while more iron ingots could be helpful later, raw copper isn't crucial for me right now.  Trading it away might make them less likely to offer something more valuable in the future.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- I need to craft a smoker, which requires a furnace and 4 logs.  A furnace requires 8 cobblestone. I have 1 cobblestone and player 1 has 1 cobblestone.  I also have 3 iron ingots and they have 2.  I have 1 raw copper and they have 2.  They also have 1 raw iron.  I should try to get more cobblestone from them, or find a way to get logs.  Since they've expressed interest in cobblestone before, I'll offer them an iron ingot for their cobblestone and raw iron.  This gives them a crafted item for two raw materials.
- My proposal looks good now.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- I need 8 cobblestone for a furnace, which is part of making a smoker. I have 1 cobblestone, and player 1 has 1.  I also need logs.  Player 1 has raw iron, raw copper, and iron ingots.  I could offer them an iron ingot, since I have more than they do.  I'll request their cobblestone and raw iron in return.  This consolidates my resources and moves me closer to my crafting goal.
- My proposal looks good now.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- I need 8 cobblestone for a furnace, a key component of the smoker. I have 1 cobblestone, and player 1 also has 1.  I also need logs, which I don't have yet.  Player 1 has raw iron, raw copper, and iron ingots.  I have an excess of iron ingots compared to them.  I'll offer them an iron ingot in exchange for their cobblestone and raw iron.  This consolidates my resources towards building a furnace and gets me closer to my crafting goal.
- My proposal looks good now.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:cobblestone * 1, minecraft:raw_iron * 1, ], offer [minecraft:iron_ingot * 1, ] together with a text message: I'll trade you an iron ingot for your cobblestone and raw iron.  This will help us both progress towards our crafting goals.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- player 2 is offering 1 iron ingot for my 1 cobblestone and 1 raw iron.  Let's see what I can make with those items.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **iron_ingot**.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I could use the iron ingot to craft higher-tier items. Trading away the cobblestone and raw iron isn't a huge loss, especially since I can smelt the raw iron into an ingot if needed. This trade seems beneficial for both of us, aligning with the cooperative nature of the game.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Sounds good! This trade will help us both.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is minecraft:stone_pickaxe. I have 3 iron ingots and 2 raw copper.  player 2 has 2 cobblestone, 2 iron ingots, 1 raw copper, and 1 raw iron. I need cobblestone to make a stone pickaxe. I just traded away my cobblestone and raw iron for an iron ingot. I should try to trade for cobblestone again.
- I need cobblestone and sticks to make a stone pickaxe. I can make sticks from planks, which I can make from logs.  player 2 has no logs or planks. I need to find a way to get logs.  I can also smelt my raw iron and raw copper into ingots.  I could offer player 2 some iron ingots for their cobblestone.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is `minecraft:blast_furnace`.  I currently have 1 cobblestone, 2 iron ingots, 1 raw copper, and 1 raw iron. The opponent has 3 iron ingots and 2 raw copper.  I just traded 1 iron ingot for 1 cobblestone and 1 raw iron.  The opponent rejected my offer of raw copper for raw iron. They seem to be accumulating iron ingots and raw copper.  I need to figure out what they are crafting and how to get the remaining items I need for the blast furnace.
- I need to review the recipe for a blast furnace and see what I'm missing.  <current status>
- Based on the item info for blast furnace, I need a total of 5 iron ingots, 3 smooth stone, and 1 furnace. I already have 2 iron ingots, so I need 3 more. I have 1 raw iron which can be smelted into 1 more iron ingot. I can craft smooth stone from cobblestone. I have 2 cobblestone, enough for 3 smooth stone. I need to craft a furnace first, which requires 8 cobblestone. I only have 2 cobblestone. I need to acquire more cobblestone.  The opponent has no cobblestone.  I need to consider trading for it or finding a way to craft it.
- I can try trading 1 iron ingot for 2 raw copper with the opponent. This would give me enough raw copper to potentially distract them if they are trying to craft something with copper.  If they refuse, I can try offering 1 iron ingot for 1 raw copper.

I need cobblestone and sticks to craft a stone pickaxe. I need to acquire cobblestone through trading.  I just traded for an iron ingot, so I have more to trade with now.
- The recipe for a stone pickaxe is 3 cobblestone and 2 sticks. I have no cobblestone and no sticks.  I have enough iron ingots to trade for the cobblestone. I need to figure out how to get sticks.  I can craft sticks from planks, and planks from logs.  I don't have any logs, and neither does player 2.  I need to find a way to get logs or sticks.  <current status>

I just traded 1 iron ingot for 1 cobblestone and 1 raw iron. The opponent rejected my offer of raw copper for raw iron, then accepted my offer of 1 iron for cobblestone + raw iron. They seem to be accumulating iron ingots and raw copper.  I need to figure out what they are crafting and how to get the remaining items I need for the blast furnace.  My priority is getting more cobblestone.
- I need 5 iron ingots, 3 smooth stone, and 1 furnace to craft a blast furnace. I have 2 iron ingots and 1 raw iron (which will smelt into another ingot). I have 1 cobblestone, which isn't enough for either smooth stone (need 3) or a furnace (need 8).  I need to acquire a significant amount of cobblestone.  Trading is the fastest way.
- Since the opponent seems interested in iron, I'll try trading iron ingots for cobblestone.  I'll start by offering 1 iron ingot for 2 cobblestone.  If that fails, I'll try 1 iron ingot for 1 cobblestone.

My last trade for cobblestone and raw iron for an iron ingot was accepted.  The opponent seems interested in iron ingots.
- I need 5 iron ingots, 3 smooth stone, and 1 furnace. I can smelt my raw iron into an iron ingot, giving me 3. I can make smooth stone from cobblestone, but I only have 1.  The biggest hurdle is the furnace, which requires 8 cobblestone.  I need to prioritize getting cobblestone.  Since the opponent seems to want iron, I'll try trading for cobblestone with iron ingots.
