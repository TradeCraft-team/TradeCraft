### üñ• Server Event: `server__private_start_info`
player 2 enters the game with a private target: [minecraft:torch * 1, ]



## üåÄ Turn 1 start!
----------------------------------------

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft shears, which requires 2 iron ingots. I currently have 1 iron ingot.  My opponent has 5 raw iron.  I can offer them coal to smelt their raw iron, and then request some of the resulting iron ingots in return. I also have some extra wood and cobblestone I could offer. Since cooperation is key, I'll offer a fair trade and explain my reasoning clearly.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **shears**.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- The item_info confirms shears requires 2 iron ingots.  My plan seems sound.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:iron_ingot * 1, ], offer [minecraft:coal * 1, minecraft:cobblestone * 1, ] together with a text message: I'm trying to craft shears, which requires two iron ingots. I have one, and noticed you have raw iron. I'm offering coal and cobblestone to help you process it.  Could you trade me one iron ingot in return after smelting? This will help us both get closer to our goals. Let me know what you think!


### üñ• Server Event: `server__proposal_invalid`
player 1's proposal is INVALID according to the game rule.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I need shears, which are crafted from two iron ingots. I have one iron ingot, and player 2 has five raw iron.  They could smelt their raw iron into iron ingots. I can offer them coal, which they can use as fuel for smelting. I could also offer cobblestone, which might be useful for them. In return, I'll request an iron ingot. Since they'll have plenty after smelting, this should be a mutually beneficial trade.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:iron_ingot * 1, ], offer [minecraft:coal * 1, minecraft:cobblestone * 1, ] together with a text message: I'm trying to craft shears, and I see you have a good amount of raw iron. I'm offering you coal to help you smelt that iron into ingots, and some cobblestone as well. In return, I'd like one iron ingot. This trade should help both of us get closer to our goals. Let me know what you think!


### üñ• Server Event: `server__proposal_invalid`
player 1's proposal is INVALID according to the game rule.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- To craft shears, I need 2 iron ingots. I currently have 1 iron ingot.  player 2 has 5 raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots. I can offer them coal to help them smelt the raw iron, and in return, request an iron ingot.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **shears**.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:iron_ingot * 1, ], offer [minecraft:coal * 1, ] together with a text message: I have 1 iron ingot and need another to craft shears. You have plenty of raw iron. I'm offering my coal to help you smelt it, and in return, I'd like to request 1 iron ingot. This trade will help us both get closer to our goals. Let me know what you think!


### üñ• Server Event: `server__proposal_invalid`
player 1's proposal is INVALID according to the game rule.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- To craft shears, I need 2 iron ingots. I currently have 1 iron ingot.  I need 1 more iron ingot. My opponent has raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots. I can offer them coal to help them smelt their raw iron, and in return, request an iron ingot.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **shears**.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My plan is to offer coal for an iron ingot.  Since they have a lot of raw iron, they likely need coal to smelt it. This trade should benefit both of us.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:iron_ingot * 1, ], offer [minecraft:coal * 1, ] together with a text message: I have coal you might need for smelting your raw iron. I'd be happy to trade it for an iron ingot.  I'm working towards shears, and that would really help me out. Let me know what you think!


### üñ• Server Event: `server__proposal_invalid`
player 1's proposal is INVALID according to the game rule.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I need to craft shears, which requires two iron ingots. I have one iron ingot, and player 2 has five raw iron.  They could smelt their raw iron into iron ingots. I can offer them coal to help them smelt the raw iron. In return, I could request an iron ingot.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **shears**.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My plan seems reasonable. I'll offer coal and request an iron ingot.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [], offer [] together with a text message: Formatting issues repeated multiple times


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- player 1 is offering nothing and requesting nothing. This is suspicious. They might be trying to stall or gather information.  I need to check how to craft a torch.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **torch**.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- I need coal and sticks to craft a torch. I have plenty of raw iron, which I can smelt into iron ingots and then craft into sticks.  player 1 has coal, which I need. Since they are offering nothing, there's no downside to rejecting this trade and trying to get coal later.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2 decided to reject the proposal with a text message: I'm not interested in this trade. I need coal.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is shears, which requires 2 iron ingots. I have coal and cobblestone, but no iron ingots. The opponent rejected my trade offer for iron ingot and said they need coal.  I need to figure out a way to get iron ingots. Maybe I can offer more coal for an iron ingot.  <current status>
- I will try to trade 2 coal for 1 iron ingot. If that doesn't work, I'll try offering all 3 of my coal.
- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a torch. I need sticks and coal/charcoal. I have raw iron and raw copper, which can be smelted into ingots. I can trade for coal or planks with the other player.  I have cobblestone which can be smelted into stone, but that's not directly useful for my goal. The other player has coal and cherry planks, which are both useful to me.
- I need to confirm the recipes for torch and how to get the ingredients.  <current status>
- Based on the available information, I can make a plan to craft a torch.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is shears, which requires 2 iron ingots. I have coal (3) and cobblestone (1).  The opponent rejected my trade offer for iron ingot and said they need coal. I offered 1 coal for 1 iron ingot, which was rejected.  They explicitly said they *need* coal, so perhaps they need more than one.  I need to figure out a way to get iron ingots. Maybe I can offer more coal for an iron ingot, or find out what they need the coal for.  <current status>
- I will try to trade 2 coal for 1 iron ingot. If that doesn't work, I'll offer all 3 of my coal. I also want to ask what they are trying to craft.
- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a torch. I need sticks and coal/charcoal. I have 2 raw copper, 5 raw iron, cobblestone, and oak planks.  The other player (player 1) has coal, cherry planks, cobblestone, iron ingot, and raw copper.  They rejected my last trade offer, citing formatting issues. I need to be more precise in my trade proposals.
- Confirming the torch recipe and ingredient requirements.  <current status>
- I have a plan to craft a torch.  I'll prioritize trading for coal since I already have oak planks. If that fails, I'll smelt my raw iron and try to trade iron ingots for coal or planks.

Maybe I can offer more coal for an iron ingot, or find out what they need the coal for. I should also check what I can craft with what I have, just in case.  <current status>
- I will review the possible recipes and then try to trade 2 coal for 1 iron ingot. If that doesn't work, I'll offer all 3 of my coal. I also want to ask what they are trying to craft.
- I think I have a good plan.

## üåÄ Turn 2 start!
----------------------------------------

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- I need a torch.  A torch is made with coal/charcoal and a stick. I have no coal or charcoal.  I can make a stick with planks, and I have oak planks.  My opponent has no obvious use for oak planks, so I can offer some in trade.  They have an iron ingot, which I could use to make shears to get wool to make a bed (a possible opponent goal).  I'll try to trade for that. I'll also check how to make charcoal.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **charcoal**.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- I need a torch. A torch is made with coal/charcoal and a stick. I can make a stick with planks, and I have oak planks. My opponent has no obvious use for oak planks, so I can offer some in trade. They have an iron ingot, which I could use to make shears to get wool to make a bed (a possible opponent goal). I'll try to trade for that. Since charcoal isn't craftable, I'll try trading for coal directly.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **stick**.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My plan is to offer 1 oak plank for their iron ingot.  I'll also ask for coal, if they have any.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:coal * 1, minecraft:iron_ingot * 1, ], offer [minecraft:oak_planks * 1, ] together with a text message: I'd like to trade an oak plank for an iron ingot. If you have any coal, I'd be happy to trade for that as well.


### üñ• Server Event: `server__proposal_invalid`
player 2's proposal is INVALID according to the game rule.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- I need coal to smelt raw iron into iron ingots.  I'll try to trade for coal again, but this time I'll offer something they might actually want, like raw iron. I'll also request less iron ingot, since they only have one.  I'll keep my message short and sweet to avoid giving away too much information.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **iron_ingot**.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- I'll offer one raw iron for one coal.  That seems like a fair trade, and it's what I need right now.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:coal * 1, ], offer [minecraft:raw_iron * 1, ] together with a text message: Need coal. Will trade iron.


### üñ• Server Event: `server__proposal_invalid`
player 2's proposal is INVALID according to the game rule.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- I need coal to smelt raw iron into iron ingots.  player 1 has iron ingots, but likely needs more raw materials. I'll offer some raw iron for coal, but I'll keep some raw iron for myself in case I can't get coal. I also need to consider what player 1 might be crafting and avoid giving them materials that would help them. They have cherry planks and a copper ingot.  I'll try to get information about recipes involving those.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **cherry_planks**.


### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **copper_ingot**.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- player 1 having a copper ingot suggests they might be aiming for something more complex.  Since I need coal, I'll offer a small amount of raw iron for coal. This is a low-risk trade for me, and it might reveal more about their plans if they accept or reject.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:coal * 1, ], offer [minecraft:raw_iron * 1, ] together with a text message: I need coal, and you have an iron ingot.  Would you trade some coal for raw iron?


### üñ• Server Event: `server__proposal_invalid`
player 2's proposal is INVALID according to the game rule.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- I have a lot of raw iron, but I need fuel to smelt it.  player 1 has an iron ingot, suggesting they have access to fuel. I'll try to trade some raw iron for coal. I'll also offer oak planks, as they seem to be collecting wood types.  Since my previous proposals were rejected due to player 1 not having coal, I'll request a cobblestone instead.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **iron_ingot**.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My proposal looks good now. Let's try this.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:cobblestone * 1, ], offer [minecraft:oak_planks * 1, minecraft:raw_iron * 1, ] together with a text message: I have plenty of iron and some wood planks to spare.  Would you trade a cobblestone?


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- They are offering me oak planks and raw iron in exchange for cobblestone. I have cobblestone to spare, and both oak planks and raw iron could be useful.  Oak planks can be used for crafting sticks, which are essential for tools, and raw iron can be smelted into iron ingots, which are also very useful. This trade seems beneficial for me.  It also aligns with the cooperative nature of the game, fostering goodwill with the other team.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Thanks! This trade helps us both.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is `minecraft:blast_furnace`.  I traded one raw iron for two cobblestone in the last turn. Now I have 2 cobblestone, 1 oak planks, 2 raw copper, and 4 raw iron. player 1 has 1 cherry planks, 1 copper ingot, 1 iron ingot, 1 oak planks, and 1 raw iron.  I still need more iron ingots and smooth stone to craft a blast furnace.
- Let's see what I can craft with my current resources. I should prioritize getting iron ingots. I can smelt raw iron into iron ingots. I also need to get smooth stone from cobblestone.  <current status>
- I have enough raw iron to make 4 iron ingots. I also have enough cobblestone to make 2 smooth stone.  My plan is to smelt all my raw iron and smelt the cobblestone. Then, I will propose a trade with player 1 for their iron ingot. If they accept, I will have enough iron ingots to craft the blast furnace. If they reject, I will continue to gather resources and try again next turn.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is `minecraft:iron_pickaxe`. I have `minecraft:cherry_planks`, `minecraft:copper_ingot`, `minecraft:iron_ingot`, `minecraft:oak_planks`, and `minecraft:raw_iron` in hand. The other player, player 2, has `minecraft:cobblestone`, `minecraft:raw_copper`, and `minecraft:raw_iron`. I successfully traded cobblestone for oak planks and raw iron last turn.  I need more iron ingots to craft an iron pickaxe.  player 2 has raw iron, but I need to smelt it into ingots. I have enough fuel (planks) to do that myself if I can trade for it.
- I need to confirm the recipe for iron pickaxe and see if there are any intermediate steps.  <current status>
- Assuming the recipe for `minecraft:iron_pickaxe` is 3 `minecraft:iron_ingot` and 2 sticks, and sticks are crafted from planks, I need to acquire more iron ingots. I currently have one iron ingot and one raw iron.  player 2 has 4 raw iron.  I could trade some planks for their raw iron.  I'll need a furnace to smelt the raw iron.
- This will tell me what I can craft right now with what I have. I should be able to make sticks.
- I think a good trade would be to offer 2 oak planks for 2 raw iron. This leaves me with enough planks to make sticks and enough fuel to smelt the raw iron.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is `minecraft:blast_furnace`. I successfully traded one raw iron for two cobblestone in the last turn. Now I have 2 cobblestone, 1 oak planks, 2 raw copper, and 4 raw iron. player 1 has 1 cherry planks, 1 copper ingot, 1 iron ingot, 1 oak planks, and 1 raw iron.  I still need more iron ingots and smooth stone to craft a blast furnace. I need to smelt my raw iron and cobblestone. I will also try to trade for player 1's iron ingot.
- I should be able to smelt all my raw iron and cobblestone with the oak planks I have.  Then I can craft the smooth stone.  <current status>
- I can smelt all my raw iron into iron ingots and smelt the cobblestone into stone, then craft smooth stone from stone. After that, I'll propose a trade with player 1 for their iron ingot.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is `minecraft:iron_pickaxe`. I have `minecraft:cherry_planks`, `minecraft:copper_ingot`, `minecraft:iron_ingot`, `minecraft:oak_planks`, and `minecraft:raw_iron` in hand.

I need more iron ingots to craft an iron pickaxe.  player 2 has 4 raw iron. I need to smelt it into ingots. I have enough fuel (planks) to do that myself if I can trade for it.
- I need to confirm the recipe for iron pickaxe and see if there are any intermediate steps. Also need to check the recipe for smelting iron.  <current status>
- I'll propose a trade for raw iron and then craft sticks and smelt the iron.  I need to be mindful of how much fuel I use when smelting.
- This will tell me what I can craft right now with what I have. I should be able to make sticks.
- I think a good trade would be to offer 2 oak planks for 2 raw iron. This leaves me with enough planks to make sticks and enough fuel to smelt the raw iron.  I'll keep the cherry planks in reserve in case I need more fuel later.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is `minecraft:blast_furnace`. I traded one raw iron for two cobblestone in the last turn. Now I have 2 cobblestone, 1 oak planks, 2 raw copper, and 4 raw iron. player 1 has 1 cherry planks, 1 copper ingot, 1 iron ingot, 1 oak planks, and 1 raw iron.

- I can smelt all my raw iron into iron ingots and smelt the cobblestone into stone, then craft smooth stone from stone. After that, I'll propose a trade with player 1 for their iron ingot.  Since they accepted a trade for raw iron before, maybe they need it for something. I'll offer them one raw copper for their iron ingot. If that doesn't work, I'll try offering both raw copper.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is `minecraft:iron_pickaxe`. I have `minecraft:cherry_planks`, `minecraft:copper_ingot`, `minecraft:iron_ingot`, `minecraft:oak_planks`, and `minecraft:raw_iron` in hand. The other player, player 2, has `minecraft:cobblestone`, `minecraft:raw_copper`, and `minecraft:raw_iron`. I successfully traded cobblestone for oak planks and raw iron last turn.  I need more iron ingots to craft an iron pickaxe.  player 2 has 4 raw iron. I have enough fuel (planks) to smelt raw iron if I can trade for it.  It seems player 2 needs coal, which I don't have.  I need to prioritize getting the iron.
- I need to confirm the recipe for iron pickaxe and see if there are any intermediate steps. Also need to check the recipe for smelting iron and how much fuel it requires.  <current status>
- I'll propose a trade for raw iron and then craft sticks and smelt the iron.  I need to be mindful of how much fuel I use when smelting and calculate the exact amount of planks needed. I'll use oak planks for fuel to preserve the cherry planks.
- This will tell me what I can craft right now with what I have. I should be able to make sticks.
- I think a good trade would be to offer 2 oak planks for 2 raw iron. This leaves me with enough planks to make sticks and enough fuel to smelt the raw iron.  I'll keep the cherry planks in reserve in case I need more fuel later or for another crafting recipe.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is `minecraft:blast_furnace`. I traded one raw iron for two cobblestone in the last turn. Now I have 2 cobblestone, 1 oak planks, 2 raw copper, and 4 raw iron. player 1 has 1 cherry planks, 1 copper ingot, 1 iron ingot, 1 oak planks, and 1 raw iron.  I still need more iron ingots and smooth stone to craft a blast furnace. I need to smelt my raw iron and cobblestone. I will also try to trade for player 1's iron ingot.
- I should be able to smelt all my raw iron and cobblestone with the oak planks I have.  Then I can craft the smooth stone.  <current status>
- I can smelt all my raw iron into iron ingots and smelt the cobblestone into stone, then craft smooth stone from stone. After that, I'll propose a trade with player 1 for their iron ingot.  Since they accepted a trade for raw iron before, maybe they need it for something. I'll offer them one raw copper for their iron ingot. If that doesn't work, I'll try offering both raw copper.  I need to be mindful of how much fuel I'm using.  Smelting 4 raw iron and 2 cobblestone will use up 6/8 of my oak plank, leaving me with 2/8.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is `minecraft:iron_pickaxe`. I have `minecraft:cherry_planks`, `minecraft:copper_ingot`, `minecraft:iron_ingot`, `minecraft:oak_planks`, and `minecraft:raw_iron` in hand. The other player, player 2, has `minecraft:cobblestone`, `minecraft:raw_copper`, and `minecraft:raw_iron`. I successfully traded cobblestone for oak planks and raw iron last turn.  I need more iron ingots to craft an iron pickaxe.  player 2 has 4 raw iron. I have enough fuel (planks) to smelt raw iron if I can trade for it.  It seems player 2 needs coal, which I don't have, but they accepted a trade for planks last turn.  I need to prioritize getting the iron. I should ask what they need in exchange for raw iron.
- I need to confirm the recipe for iron pickaxe and see if there are any intermediate steps. Also need to check the recipe for smelting iron and how much fuel it requires.  <current status>
- I'll propose a trade for raw iron and then craft sticks and smelt the iron.  I need to be mindful of how much fuel I use when smelting and calculate the exact amount of planks needed. I'll use oak planks for fuel to preserve the cherry planks.
- This will tell me what I can craft right now with what I have. I should be able to make sticks.
- I think a good trade would be to offer 2 oak planks for 2 raw iron. This leaves me with enough planks to make sticks and enough fuel to smelt the raw iron.  I'll keep the cherry planks in reserve in case I need more fuel later or for another crafting recipe.  I'll explicitly ask player 2 what they need.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is `minecraft:blast_furnace`. I traded one raw iron for two cobblestone in the last turn. Now I have 2 cobblestone, 1 oak planks, 2 raw copper, and 4 raw iron. player 1 has 1 cherry planks, 1 copper ingot, 1 iron ingot, 1 oak planks, and 1 raw iron.  I still need more iron ingots and smooth stone to craft a blast furnace. I need to smelt my raw iron and cobblestone. I will also try to trade for player 1's iron ingot.

I need to be mindful of how much fuel I'm using.  Smelting 4 raw iron and 2 cobblestone will use up 6/8 of my oak plank, leaving me with 2/8 or 1/4.  I'll specify oak planks as the fuel in the recipe check.

## üåÄ Turn 3 start!
----------------------------------------

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I have two iron ingots, one copper ingot, and one oak plank.  player 2 has raw iron, raw copper, cobblestone, and cobblestone slabs.  I could offer an iron ingot for some raw iron to help them progress.  I could also offer my copper ingot for their raw copper.  Since they have cobblestone slabs, they likely have a stone cutter, so cobblestone might be less valuable to them.  I'll offer the iron ingot for two raw iron.
- My proposal looks good now.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My previous proposals to trade for iron ingots were rejected because player 2 didn't have any.  They now have raw iron, which I could use.  I'll offer my extra iron ingot for two raw iron. This helps them get closer to crafting more iron ingots, and helps me accumulate resources.  This aligns with the cooperative nature of the game.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:iron_ingot * 1, ] together with a text message: I have an extra iron ingot. Would you trade two raw iron for it? This could help you craft more iron ingots.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- player 1 is offering a processed material for raw materials. This seems beneficial to me as it saves me a crafting step and fuel. However, I need to consider if this trade benefits them more than it benefits me, and if it helps them achieve their crafting goal faster.  I also need to consider if I need the raw iron for something else.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **iron_ingot**.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- Accepting the trade saves me fuel and a crafting step.  It seems like a small win for me, but it could be a bigger win for them if they are trying to deprive me of raw iron. I'll accept, but I'll be wary of future trades.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Thanks for the offer.  I could use the iron ingot.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is minecraft:iron_pickaxe.  I currently have 1 copper ingot, 1 iron ingot, 1 oak planks, and 2 raw iron. The other player has 1 cobblestone, 2 cobblestone slabs, 1 iron ingot, 2 raw copper, and 2 raw iron. I just traded an iron ingot to the other player for 2 raw iron. I need more iron ingots to make an iron pickaxe. I can smelt my raw iron into iron ingots.
- I need 3 iron ingots total for the iron pickaxe. I have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron. Smelting the raw iron will give me 2 more iron ingots, for a total of 3. I can craft the pickaxe next turn.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is `minecraft:blast_furnace`.  The opponent has `minecraft:copper_ingot: 1`, `minecraft:iron_ingot: 1`, `minecraft:oak_planks: 1`, and `minecraft:raw_iron: 2`. I have `minecraft:cobblestone: 1`, `minecraft:cobblestone_slab: 2`, `minecraft:iron_ingot: 1`, `minecraft:raw_copper: 2`, and `minecraft:raw_iron: 2`. I need to acquire more iron ingots and smooth stone to craft a blast furnace.  I can smelt my raw iron into iron ingots, and I can also smelt my raw copper into copper ingots, which I can potentially trade.  The opponent seems to be focusing on iron, so they might be trying to craft something iron-related.  I should try to trade for more iron ingots if possible.
- Let's see what I can craft with my current resources.  <current status>
- Based on the available recipes, I can smelt my raw iron and raw copper. I can also craft more cobblestone slabs, but that doesn't seem strategically useful right now.  My priority is to get more iron ingots.
- I will smelt my raw materials. Then, I will propose a trade with the opponent for their iron ingot, offering them a copper ingot in return.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is minecraft:iron_pickaxe. I currently have 1 copper ingot, 1 iron ingot, 1 oak planks, and 2 raw iron. The other player has 1 cobblestone, 2 cobblestone slabs, 1 iron ingot, 2 raw copper, and 2 raw iron. I just traded an iron ingot to the other player for 2 raw iron.  I need to smelt my raw iron into iron ingots. I also need sticks.
- I need 3 iron ingots and 2 sticks to craft an iron pickaxe. I have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron. Smelting the raw iron will give me 2 more iron ingots, for a total of 3. I can craft the pickaxe next turn. I can make sticks from planks.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

I have `minecraft:cobblestone: 1`, `minecraft:cobblestone_slab: 2`, `minecraft:iron_ingot: 1`, `minecraft:raw_copper: 2`, and `minecraft:raw_iron: 2`. I need more iron ingots and smooth stone to craft a blast furnace.  I can smelt my raw iron and raw copper.  The opponent might be aiming for iron-related items, given their previous trades. I should try to trade for more iron ingots and acquire smooth stone.
- Let's see what I can craft with my current resources.  <current status>
- I can smelt my raw iron and raw copper. I can also make more cobblestone slabs, but that's not a priority.  I need to focus on getting smooth stone. I can make that from cobblestone by smelting it.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is minecraft:iron_pickaxe. I currently have 1 copper ingot, 1 iron ingot, 1 oak planks, and 2 raw iron.

I need to smelt my raw iron into iron ingots. I also need sticks.
- I need 3 iron ingots and 2 sticks to craft an iron pickaxe. I have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron. Smelting the raw iron will give me 2 more iron ingots, for a total of 3. I can craft the pickaxe next turn. I can make sticks from planks.  I need to calculate exactly how many planks I need for the fuel and the sticks.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:

I should try to trade for more iron ingots and acquire smooth stone.  I also need fuel for smelting.
- Let's see what I can craft with my current resources.  <current status>
- I can smelt my raw iron and raw copper. I can also make more cobblestone slabs, but that's not a priority.  I need to focus on getting smooth stone. I can make that from cobblestone by smelting it. I'll need fuel for that.  Since the opponent has planks, I'll try to trade for those first.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is minecraft:iron_pickaxe. I currently have 1 copper ingot, 1 iron ingot, 1 oak planks, and 2 raw iron. The other player has 1 cobblestone, 2 cobblestone slabs, 1 iron ingot, 2 raw copper, and 2 raw iron. I just traded an iron ingot to the other player for 2 raw iron.  I need to smelt my raw iron into iron ingots. I also need sticks.
- I need 3 iron ingots and 2 sticks to craft an iron pickaxe. I have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron. Smelting the raw iron will give me 2 more iron ingots, for a total of 3. I can craft the pickaxe next turn. I can make sticks from planks.  I need to calculate exactly how many planks I need for the fuel and the sticks.  Since planks are divisible, I can express the amounts as fractions.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- Let's see what I can craft with my current resources.  <current status>
- I can smelt my raw iron and raw copper. I can also make more cobblestone slabs, but that's not a priority.  I need to focus on getting smooth stone. I can make that from cobblestone by smelting it. I'll need fuel for that.  Since the opponent has planks, I'll try to trade for those first. If that fails, I can try trading for coal directly.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is minecraft:iron_pickaxe. I currently have 1 copper ingot, 1 iron ingot, 1 oak planks, and 2 raw iron.

I need to smelt my raw iron into iron ingots. I also need sticks.  I can make the sticks from the oak planks.
- I need 3 iron ingots and 2 sticks to craft an iron pickaxe. I have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron. Smelting the raw iron will give me 2 more iron ingots, for a total of 3. I can craft the pickaxe next turn. I can make sticks from planks.  I need to calculate exactly how many planks I need for the fuel and the sticks.  Since planks are divisible, I can express the amounts as fractions.  The recipe for smelting iron is: ```json "input": { "minecraft:raw_iron": 1, "minecraft:fuel": { "n": 1, "d": 8 } }, "output": { "minecraft:iron_ingot": 1 } } ``` So for 2 raw iron, I need 1/4 fuel.  <current status>

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- I have a decent amount of cobblestone slabs, which might not be directly useful to me right now.  player 1 has more iron ingots than I do.  Perhaps I can trade some slabs for another iron ingot.  This would help me accumulate iron for potential future crafting.  I also need to consider what player 1 might need, and how I can use the trade to learn more about their target item.  They seem to be focusing on iron and copper, so maybe they need fuel for smelting.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **iron_ingot**.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- I'll offer two cobblestone slabs and request one iron ingot.  This seems like a fair trade, and it moves me closer to crafting items that require iron.  I'll also ask about what they're planning to craft, to try and gather information.

player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:iron_ingot * 1, ], offer [minecraft:cobblestone_slab * 2, ] together with a text message: I have extra cobblestone slabs. Would you trade an iron ingot for them? Also, what are you planning to craft?


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I have two iron ingots and one raw iron.  I could smelt the raw iron into another ingot.  I'm not sure what my target item is yet, so I don't know if I'll need the iron ingots or not.  Cobblestone slabs could be useful for building, but I don't have a specific need for them right now.  player 2 is asking what I'm planning to craft, which suggests they are trying to be helpful.  Sharing information is part of the cooperative strategy.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **iron_ingot**.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- Trading an iron ingot for two cobblestone slabs doesn't seem like a good trade right now. I can likely get cobblestone later if needed.  I'll tell player 2 what I'm trying to make and see if they can help.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1 decided to reject the proposal with a text message: I'm working towards crafting a [your target item]. Do you have any [components of your target item] you'd be willing to trade?


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is minecraft:iron_axe. I have 2 iron ingots and 1 raw iron. The opponent has 2 raw iron and 2 raw copper. I offered to trade 1 iron ingot for 2 raw iron, but the offer was rejected.  The opponent asked what I'm planning to craft. They seem to have extra cobblestone slabs. I need sticks to craft the iron axe. I can craft sticks from planks. I have oak planks.  <current status>
- I can craft sticks using my oak planks. Then I can use the sticks and iron ingots to craft the iron axe.
- I'll check what I can craft with my current resources.  Then I'll craft the sticks and then the axe. I should also consider what to do with the raw iron I have. I could try to trade it for something useful or smelt it into an iron ingot.  I should also try to figure out what the opponent's target is.  Since they have raw copper and raw iron, maybe they are trying to craft something that requires those materials.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is `minecraft:iron_pickaxe`. I have 2 raw_iron, 2 raw_copper, 4 cobblestone_slab, and 1 iron_ingot.  The opponent has 1 raw_iron, 2 iron_ingot, and 1 copper_ingot.  My last trade offer was rejected. They claim to be working towards my target item, which is a bluff.  I need more iron to make an iron pickaxe. I can smelt raw iron into iron ingots, but I need fuel. I don't have any fuel.  My opponent likely needs cobblestone for something.
- Let's see what I can craft with what I have.  <current status>
- I can smelt my raw materials if I can get fuel.  I can also trade my raw copper for something useful, perhaps cobblestone to make a furnace.  I should try to get coal from my opponent.
- Reviewing the recipe for my target.  <current status>
- I need 3 iron ingots and 2 sticks.  Sticks are made from planks, which are made from logs.  I don't have any of those.  I need to prioritize getting more iron first.  Trading for coal is the best option.
- I'll offer my opponent 1 raw copper for 1 coal.  If they refuse, I'll offer 2 raw copper for 1 coal.  If they still refuse, I'll have to consider other options.  <current status>

The opponent offered to trade 2 cobblestone slabs for 1 iron ingot. I rejected the offer because I need the iron ingots.  The opponent asked what I'm planning to craft.  <current status>

- I'll check what I can craft with my current resources.  I'll prioritize crafting sticks if I can get more planks. Then I'll craft the iron axe. I should also smelt the raw iron into an iron ingot. I need to find a source of fuel for the furnace.
- Reviewing the recipe for the iron axe to make sure I have the correct requirements.

I can smelt raw iron into iron ingots, but I need fuel. I don't have any fuel.  My opponent likely needs cobblestone for something, but I need my slabs.  I need to secure fuel.
- Let's see what I can craft with what I have.  I know I can't craft anything significant without fuel.  <current status>
- As expected, I can't craft much without fuel.  Trading for coal is still the priority.  I'll try offering increasingly better deals for coal.  If that fails, I'll have to consider trading for logs.
- Reviewing the recipe for my target to ensure I'm prioritizing correctly.  <current status>
- Still need 3 iron ingots and 2 sticks.  I'm short 2 iron ingots.  Focusing on getting fuel to smelt my raw iron.
