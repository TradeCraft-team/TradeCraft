## üåÄ Turn 1 start!
----------------------------------------

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a chain.  I need iron ingots for that. I already have one iron ingot. My opponent has a lot of raw iron. I should try to trade for some of that raw iron. I also need fuel for smelting the raw iron. I have coal, which is a good fuel source.  I'll offer some of my excess materials that don't directly contribute to my goal, like cherry planks and cobblestone. I'll try to get 2 raw iron in exchange for the cherry planks and cobblestone.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **chain**.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- I need two iron ingots total to make a chain. I already have one, so I need one more.  It takes one raw iron to make one iron ingot.  My opponent has five raw iron.  I'll request two raw iron, just in case I need extra fuel.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:cherry_planks * 1, minecraft:cobblestone * 1, ] together with a text message: I have some extra wood and stone if you're interested. I'm looking for some raw iron.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a stone_shovel.  I need cobblestone and sticks. I already have one cobblestone. Sticks are crafted from planks.  This trade offers me another cobblestone and some cherry planks.  This trade helps me get closer to my goal.  player 2 said they need iron, which suggests their goal might require it. Helping them may encourage future cooperation.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **stone_shovel**.


### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: This trade works well for me. I need the cobblestone and planks to make sticks. Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with!


### üñ• Server Event: `server__update_all_hands`
Server updated all hands:
player 2 hand: [minecraft:coal * 1, minecraft:iron_ingot * 1, minecraft:raw_copper * 1, minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ]
player 1 hand: [minecraft:cherry_planks * 1, minecraft:cobblestone * 2, minecraft:oak_planks * 1, minecraft:raw_copper * 2, minecraft:raw_iron * 3, ]


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I need cobblestone and sticks. I have enough cobblestone.  I need to craft sticks. Sticks require planks. I have oak_planks and cherry_planks. I can use either.
- I accepted a trade from player 2. They offered cobblestone and cherry planks for raw iron. This was beneficial for me as I need both of those items to craft my target.  <current status>
- I will craft sticks using my oak planks. Then I will craft the stone_shovel.
- I'm checking possible recipes to make sure I have the correct amounts for crafting.
- Confirming the stick recipe.
- Confirming the stone_shovel recipe.
- I have enough materials to craft the stone_shovel.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a chain. I need 2 iron ingots and 1 raw iron to craft it. I have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron.  I need to acquire one more iron ingot. My opponent has 3 raw iron, which they could use to make iron ingots. I should try to trade for an iron ingot from them.
- I'll check the recipe for chain again to make sure I have the requirements correct.  I also need to consider what my opponent might be trying to craft. They accepted a trade for cobblestone and planks, which suggests they might be trying to make sticks, and potentially tools or weapons.  They have enough raw iron to make a few iron ingots, so they could be aiming for something more complex. I need to be careful not to give them anything that would help them too much.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I need cobblestone and sticks. I have 2 cobblestone.  I need to craft sticks. Sticks require planks. I have oak_planks and cherry_planks. I can use either. I have enough materials to craft the stone shovel.  <current status>
- I will craft sticks using my oak planks. Then I will craft the stone_shovel.
- Checking possible recipes to make sure I have the correct amounts for crafting.  I want to see if there are any unexpected crafting opportunities.
- Confirming the stick recipe.
- Confirming the stone_shovel recipe.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a chain. I need 2 iron ingots and 1 raw iron to craft it. I have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron.  I need to acquire one more iron ingot. My opponent has 3 raw iron, which they could use to make iron ingots. I should try to trade for an iron ingot from them, or prevent them from smelting their raw iron.
- I'll check the recipe for iron ingot to see how many raw iron my opponent needs to make one. This will help me determine a fair trade and understand their potential crafting options. I also need to consider what my opponent might be trying to craft. They accepted a trade for cobblestone and planks, which suggests they might be trying to craft sticks, and potentially tools or weapons.  They have enough raw iron to make a few iron ingots, so they could be aiming for something more complex. I need to be careful not to give them anything that would help them too much.  Perhaps offering coal for raw iron would be beneficial, as it depletes their resources and gives me fuel for later crafting if needed.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I need cobblestone and sticks. I have 2 cobblestone.  I need to craft sticks. Sticks require planks. I have 1 oak_planks and 1 cherry_planks. I don't have enough planks to craft sticks. I need to trade for more planks.  <current status>
- I will ask player 2 if they have any extra planks they are willing to trade. I can offer them some raw iron or raw copper in return.
- If I can get enough planks, I will craft sticks and then the stone_shovel.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I need cobblestone and sticks. I have 2 cobblestone.  I need to craft sticks. Sticks require 2 planks. I have 1 oak_planks and 1 cherry_planks. I don't have enough planks of either type to craft sticks. I need 1 more plank.  <current status>
- I will ask player 2 if they have any extra planks they are willing to trade. I can offer them some raw iron or raw copper in return.  I'll prioritize oak planks to match what I already have.
- If I can get one more plank, I will craft sticks and then the stone_shovel.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a chain. I need 2 iron ingots and 1 raw iron to craft it. I have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron.  I need to acquire one more iron ingot. My opponent has 3 raw iron, which they could use to make iron ingots. I should try to trade for an iron ingot from them, or prevent them from smelting their raw iron.  I could also check what I can craft with my current resources.
- Checking possible recipes will help me understand if I can make anything useful with my current materials, or if I need to focus solely on trading for the missing iron ingot. I also need to consider what my opponent might be trying to craft. They accepted a trade for cobblestone and planks, which suggests they might be trying to craft sticks, and potentially tools or weapons.  They have enough raw iron to make a few iron ingots, so they could be aiming for something more complex. I need to be careful not to give them anything that would help them too much.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I need cobblestone and sticks. I have 2 cobblestone.  I need to craft sticks. Sticks require 2 planks. I have 1 oak_planks and 1 cherry_planks. I don't have enough planks of a single type to craft sticks. I need 1 more plank of either type.  <current status>
- I will ask player 2 if they have any extra planks they are willing to trade. I can offer them some raw iron or raw copper in return.  I'll specify I need either oak or cherry.
- If I can get one more plank, I will craft sticks and then the stone_shovel.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **stick**.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a chain. I need 2 iron ingots and 1 raw iron to craft it. I have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron.  I need to acquire one more iron ingot. My opponent has 3 raw iron, which they could use to make iron ingots. I should try to trade for an iron ingot from them, or prevent them from smelting their raw iron.  I could also check what I can craft with my current resources. I also traded away cobblestone and planks, which could be used for sticks.
- Checking possible recipes will help me understand if I can make anything useful with my current materials, or if I need to focus solely on trading for the missing iron ingot. I also need to consider what my opponent might be trying to craft. They accepted a trade for cobblestone and planks, which suggests they might be trying to craft sticks, and potentially tools or weapons.  They have enough raw iron to make a few iron ingots, so they could be aiming for something more complex. I need to be careful not to give them anything that would help them too much.  Perhaps offering coal for raw iron would be beneficial, as it depletes their resources and gives me fuel for later crafting if needed.  Since I traded away my cobblestone, they now have enough to make a stone pickaxe, which requires 2 sticks and 3 cobblestone. They could also make a stone axe (2 sticks, 3 cobblestone), stone hoe (2 sticks, 2 cobblestone), or stone shovel (2 sticks, 1 cobblestone).  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.
