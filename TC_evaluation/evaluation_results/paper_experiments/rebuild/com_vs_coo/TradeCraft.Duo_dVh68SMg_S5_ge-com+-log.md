### üñ• Server Event: `server__private_start_info`
player 1 enters the game with a private target: [minecraft:lever * 1, ]



## üåÄ Turn 1 start!
----------------------------------------

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a chain.  I need iron ingots for that. I already have one iron ingot. My opponent has a lot of raw iron. I should try to trade for some of that raw iron. I also need fuel for smelting the raw iron. I have coal, which is a good fuel source.  I'll offer some of my excess materials that don't directly help me make a chain, like cherry planks and cobblestone. I'll try to make the trade seem beneficial to them while prioritizing getting the raw iron I need.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **chain**.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- I need two iron ingots or one iron ingot and two iron nuggets to craft a chain.  Since my opponent has raw iron, I'll request that.  I'll offer cobblestone and cherry planks, which are less useful to me right now.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:cherry_planks * 1, minecraft:cobblestone * 1, ] together with a text message: I have some extra cobblestone and cherry planks I don't need.  I'd be willing to trade them for some of your raw iron.  Let me know if you're interested.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- They are offering 1 cherry plank and 1 cobblestone for 2 raw iron.  I need a lever. Let me check the recipe for a lever.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **lever**.


### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Thanks for the trade.  I need cobblestone to make a lever.


### üñ• Server Event: `server__update_all_hands`
Server updated all hands:
player 2 hand: [minecraft:coal * 1, minecraft:iron_ingot * 1, minecraft:raw_copper * 1, minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ]
player 1 hand: [minecraft:cherry_planks * 1, minecraft:cobblestone * 2, minecraft:oak_planks * 1, minecraft:raw_copper * 2, minecraft:raw_iron * 3, ]


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a lever. I need a stick and cobblestone. I have 2 cobblestone and I need 1. I need to craft a stick.  I have 1 oak_planks and 1 cherry_planks.  Either can be used to make sticks.  My opponent has coal and iron_ingot.  I have raw_iron and raw_copper.  I could smelt my raw_iron into iron_ingots if I had coal.
- I confirmed the recipe for a lever.  I need 1 cobblestone and 1 stick.
- I confirmed the recipe for sticks. I need 2 planks to make 4 sticks. I have enough planks.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a chain. I need iron ingots to craft it. I currently have one iron ingot and two raw iron.  My opponent has three raw iron. I traded away cobblestone for raw iron last turn, which was a good move. I need to smelt my raw iron and consider trading for more from my opponent.  They seem to be collecting cobblestone, perhaps for levers or other stone-related crafts.
- I need to review how to make iron ingots and chains to solidify my plan.
- Okay, I've reviewed the recipes.  I can smelt my raw iron into ingots using a furnace and fuel. I have coal, which is a fuel source.  Two raw iron will give me two iron ingots. With my existing iron ingot, I'll have three in total. I need two iron ingots and two raw copper to make a chain. I have one raw copper, and my opponent has two.  Trading for one more raw copper seems like the best path forward.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a lever. I need a stick and cobblestone. I have 2 cobblestone and I need 1. I need to craft a stick.  I have 1 oak_planks and 1 cherry_planks. Either can be used to make sticks. My opponent has coal and iron_ingot. I have raw_iron and raw_copper. I could smelt my raw_iron into iron_ingots if I had coal.  I should ask my opponent if they would trade coal for raw iron or raw copper.
- I confirmed the recipe for a lever.  I need 1 cobblestone and 1 stick.
- I confirmed the recipe for sticks. I need 2 planks to make 4 sticks. I have enough planks to make more than one stick.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a chain. I need 2 iron ingots and 2 raw copper. I have 1 iron ingot, 2 raw iron, and 1 raw copper. My opponent has 3 raw iron and 2 raw copper. I traded cobblestone for raw iron last turn. My opponent accepted the trade and mentioned needing cobblestone for a lever. This suggests their target might involve redstone components.
- Confirming the chain recipe.
- Checking how to make iron ingots.
- I have enough coal to smelt my raw iron. I need to acquire one more raw copper from my opponent. Since they accepted the cobblestone trade and mentioned needing it for a lever, I can try offering them something else they might need for redstone-related crafts.  Perhaps they need sticks for the lever? I can craft sticks from my cherry planks.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a lever. I need a stick and cobblestone. I have 2 cobblestone and I need 1. I need to craft a stick.  I have 1 oak_planks and 1 cherry_planks. Either can be used to make sticks. My opponent has coal and iron_ingot. I have raw_iron and raw_copper. I could smelt my raw_iron into iron_ingots if I had coal.  I should ask my opponent if they would trade coal for raw iron or raw copper. I only need 1 plank to make enough sticks for a lever.
- I confirmed the recipe for a lever.  I need 1 cobblestone and 1 stick.
- I confirmed the recipe for sticks. I need 2 planks to make 4 sticks. I have enough planks to make more than one stick. I will use oak planks since I only need 1 and have 1.  <current status>

- I confirmed the recipe for a lever.  I need 1 cobblestone and 1 stick.

Offering a smaller amount initially is a good starting point.
