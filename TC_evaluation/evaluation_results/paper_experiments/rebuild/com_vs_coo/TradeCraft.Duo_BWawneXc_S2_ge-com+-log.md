## 🌀 Turn 1 start!
----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a bucket.  Buckets require iron ingots. I already have one iron ingot.  I need two more. My opponent has a lot of raw iron. I should try to trade for some. I also need fuel for the furnace. I have coal, which is a good fuel source.  I'll offer some of my excess materials that don't directly contribute to my goal, like cherry planks and cobblestone.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **bucket**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- The item_info confirms that I need 3 iron ingots for a bucket.  I'll request 2 raw iron from my opponent and offer cherry planks and cobblestone in return.  This trade helps me get closer to my goal without giving away anything essential.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:cherry_planks * 1, minecraft:cobblestone * 1, ] together with a text message: I have some extra wood and stone if you're interested.  I'm looking for raw iron.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- They are offering 1 cherry plank and 1 cobblestone for 2 raw iron. I need cobblestone to make a stone shovel, which is my target.  I have plenty of raw iron. This trade seems beneficial to me.  It also aligns with the cooperative spirit of the game.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Thanks! This trade helps me a lot.

- My target is a bucket.  I need 3 iron ingots to craft it. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron.  My opponent has 3 raw iron. I traded away my cherry planks last turn for some raw iron. I need to smelt my raw iron and consider trading for more from my opponent.
- I need to see how to make iron ingots and what other recipes might be useful.
- Based on the recipes and my current hand, I can smelt my raw iron into iron ingots. I'll need fuel for that. I have 1 coal, which should be enough.  I should also see if my opponent is willing to trade more raw iron.  They have 3 raw iron, and I need 2 more.  I could offer them my raw copper, which I don't currently need.  <current status>
