## 🌀 Turn 1 start!
----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I need to craft a bucket.  Buckets are made of iron ingots. I have one iron ingot. I need two more. My opponent has a lot of raw iron. I should try to trade for some raw iron, then smelt it into iron ingots.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **bucket**.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I need two more iron ingots.  It takes one raw iron to make one iron ingot.  My opponent has five raw iron. I will offer them my coal and cobblestone for two raw iron.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:coal * 1, minecraft:cobblestone * 1, ] together with a text message: I need two raw iron to make a bucket. I will give you my coal and cobblestone for two of your raw iron.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I need to determine if this trade helps me get closer to my target item, which is a lever. Let me first check what's needed to craft a lever.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **lever**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I see that to craft a lever, I need 1 cobblestone and 1 stick. Let me check how to craft a stick.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **stick**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- Looking at the recipe for a lever, I need: 1. 1 cobblestone 2. 1 stick  To make a stick, I need planks. I currently have oak_planks, which can be used to craft sticks (2 planks = 4 sticks).  My current inventory: - minecraft:cobblestone: 1 - minecraft:oak_planks: 1 - minecraft:raw_copper: 2 - minecraft:raw_iron: 5  Player 1 is offering: - minecraft:coal: 1 - minecraft:cobblestone: 1  In exchange for: - minecraft:raw_iron: 2  Analyzing this trade: - I already have 1 cobblestone, which is exactly what I need for the lever - I have oak_planks to make sticks - The additional cobblestone from the trade would be redundant for my goal - Coal isn't directly needed for crafting a lever - I would lose 2 raw_iron, but that's not needed for my target item  This trade doesn't help me progress toward crafting a lever. I already have all the materials I need to craft my target item. Trading away raw_iron for materials I don't need would be unnecessary.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2 decided to reject the proposal with a text message: I appreciate the offer, but I already have the cobblestone I need for my current crafting plans. I'd prefer to hold onto my raw iron for now.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- First, I need to understand what a lever is and how to craft it. Let me check the recipe for a lever.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket.  I need 3 iron ingots to craft it. I currently have 1 iron ingot.  Player 2 has 5 raw iron, which can be smelted into 5 iron ingots. I need to trade for at least 2 iron ingots or 2 raw iron. I have coal, which Player 2 might need for smelting. I can offer some coal in exchange for the iron.
- I need to confirm the bucket recipe.  I also need to check what I can craft with my current resources, in case I can't trade for enough iron.
- I'll offer Player 2 1 coal for 2 raw iron. This seems like a fair trade, as he needs fuel for smelting. If he rejects, I'll try offering more coal or crafting something else he might need.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:coal * 1, ], offer [minecraft:raw_iron * 1, ] together with a text message: I notice you have coal which would be very useful for me to smelt some of my raw materials. I have plenty of raw iron and am willing to trade 1 raw iron for your coal. This should be beneficial for both of us - you get materials for crafting and I get fuel for smelting. What do you think?


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a bucket.  Buckets are made of iron ingots.  Trading my coal for raw iron gets me closer to having enough iron to make a bucket. I already have one iron ingot. Two more and I can craft the bucket. This trade seems beneficial.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Sounds good. I could use the iron.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket. I need 3 iron ingots to craft it. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 1 raw iron.  Player 2 has 4 raw iron. I need to trade for at least 2 more raw iron from Player 2 to be able to craft a bucket. I also have coal, cobblestone, and cherry planks. Player 2 has cobblestone and oak planks.  I should try to trade my extra resources for raw iron.

I should try to trade my extra resources for raw iron.  Since my last offer of cherry planks and cobblestone was rejected, I need to make a more appealing offer this time. I could offer my iron ingot, but that would put me a turn behind.  Maybe I should try trading for coal first, then use the coal to sweeten a deal for the raw iron.

I'd be willing to trade my raw copper and cobblestone for your iron ingot. Let me know if you're interested.

I already have 1 cobblestone in my hand, so I don't necessarily need more cobblestone.  To make a stick, I need 2 planks, which will give me 4 sticks. I currently have oak_planks in my inventory, so I can already craft sticks and then a lever with my existing materials.  Looking at the proposal, player 1 wants my iron_ingot in exchange for cobblestone and raw_copper. Since I already have the cobblestone I need for my lever, getting another cobblestone doesn't help me reach my goal. The raw_copper also doesn't seem immediately useful for crafting a lever.  On the other hand, iron_ingot could potentially be useful for other crafting recipes if our plans change. Also, player 1 mentioned they need the iron_ingot to craft a bucket, which suggests they might be pursuing a different target item.  Since I already have all the materials I need to craft my target (lever), and the offered items don't provide additional value toward my goal, I should reject this trade.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2 decided to reject the proposal with a text message: I appreciate the offer, but I need to keep my iron ingot for now. I already have the cobblestone I need for my current crafting plans.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- First, I need to understand what a lever is and how to craft it. Then I'll check what items we have and what we need to craft our target.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket. I need 3 iron ingots to craft it. I currently have 2 iron ingots.  Player 2 has 3 raw iron, which can be smelted into 3 iron ingots. I have 1 raw copper which I don't need.  I also have 1 cobblestone. Player 2 has 2 raw copper, 1 cobblestone, and 1 oak planks.  I need to get 1 more iron ingot or convince Player 2 to craft a bucket for me and trade it to me. Trading for raw iron and smelting it myself seems like the most straightforward path.
- I'm checking the recipe for a bucket again to make sure I'm not missing anything.  <current status>
- I will try to trade my raw copper and cobblestone for 1 raw iron from Player 2. This seems like a fair trade, as I'm offering two items for one.

Trading for raw iron and smelting it myself seems like the most straightforward path. I could also try trading for a crafted iron ingot directly.
- I've reviewed the crafting recipe for iron ingots.  I need to offer Player 2 something compelling to trade for either raw iron or a crafted iron ingot.  Since they accepted a trade for coal before, perhaps they are prioritizing smelting.  I don't have any fuel to offer this time.  Maybe offering both my raw copper and cobblestone for a single iron ingot would be enticing enough.  If not, I'll try offering them for raw iron instead.

Trading for raw iron and smelting it myself seems like the most straightforward path. I could also try trading for a crafted iron ingot directly.  I need fuel to smelt raw iron.
- I've reviewed the crafting recipe for iron ingots.  I need to offer Player 2 something compelling to trade for either raw iron or a crafted iron ingot.  Since they accepted a trade for coal before, perhaps they are prioritizing smelting.  I don't have any fuel to offer this time.  Maybe offering both my raw copper and cobblestone for a single iron ingot would be enticing enough.  If not, I'll try offering them for raw iron instead.  If I get the raw iron, I'll need fuel to smelt it. I could try trading for some fuel as well, or see if I can craft something that can be used as fuel.

Maybe offering both my raw copper and cobblestone for a single iron ingot would be enticing enough.  If not, I'll try offering them for raw iron *and* their oak plank, so I have fuel to smelt it.

## 🌀 Turn 4 start!
----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I need to make a proposal to help my team craft a lever. Let me first check what's needed to craft a lever.
- To craft a lever, I need: 1. 1 cobblestone 2. 1 stick  I already have 1 cobblestone, but I need a stick. Let me check how to craft a stick.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I see that I can craft sticks from planks. I already have oak_planks in my inventory, so I can craft sticks myself. I don't need to trade for sticks.  Looking at my current inventory: - minecraft:cobblestone: 1 - minecraft:iron_ingot: 1 - minecraft:oak_planks: 1 - minecraft:raw_copper: 2 - minecraft:raw_iron: 3  And my opponent's inventory: - minecraft:cobblestone: 1 - minecraft:iron_ingot: 2 - minecraft:raw_copper: 1  I don't need anything specific from my opponent to craft a lever. However, I should consider what might be useful for future crafting. Let me think about what I could offer and request.  I could offer some raw_copper since I have 2 and my opponent only has 1. In return, I might ask for something I don't have but could be useful.  Let me check what raw_copper can be used for:
- Raw copper can be smelted into copper ingots. Let me check what copper ingots can be used for:

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- Now I have a better understanding of my options. To craft a lever, I need: 1. 1 cobblestone (which I already have) 2. 1 stick (which I can craft from my oak_planks)  Since I don't need anything specific from my opponent to craft a lever, I'll make a proposal that helps maintain good trading relations while potentially getting something useful.  Looking at our inventories: - I have: cobblestone (1), iron_ingot (1), oak_planks (1), raw_copper (2), raw_iron (3) - Opponent has: cobblestone (1), iron_ingot (2), raw_copper (1)  I notice my opponent has been trying to get more iron ingots (they tried to trade for one last turn). They might be trying to craft something that requires multiple iron ingots.  I could offer some of my raw_iron in exchange for something I don't have. Since I already have what I need for a lever, I could make a friendly trade to maintain good relations.  I'll propose trading 1 raw_iron for their 1 raw_copper. This would give them more iron to work with, and I'd get an additional raw_copper which could be useful later.

- My proposal looks good now. I'll offer 1 raw_iron in exchange for 1 raw_copper. This is a fair trade that should help both of us.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- To craft a lever, I need 1 cobblestone and 1 stick. I already have cobblestone, and I can craft sticks from my oak planks. Looking at my opponent's inventory, they seem interested in iron (they tried to trade for iron ingots last turn). I can offer some of my raw iron in exchange for raw copper, which could be useful later.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:raw_copper * 1, ], offer [minecraft:raw_iron * 1, ] together with a text message: I noticed you might need more iron for your crafting. I can offer you 1 raw_iron in exchange for 1 raw_copper. This should help both of us with our crafting goals. I already have what I need for my immediate crafting, so I'm happy to help you out with some iron.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket, which requires 3 iron ingots. I currently have 2 iron ingots. Trading my raw copper for raw iron would allow me to smelt the raw iron into an iron ingot, getting me closer to my goal.  Player 2 has more raw iron than I do, and I don't have an immediate use for the raw copper. This trade seems beneficial to me.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Thanks! This trade helps me out a lot.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- First, I need to understand what a lever requires to craft and check if we have the necessary materials or need to trade for them.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket. I need 3 iron ingots to craft it. I currently have 2 iron ingots and 1 raw iron.  Player 2 has 2 raw iron and 1 iron ingot. I need to get 1 more iron ingot or 2 raw iron. Trading for the iron ingot directly failed last turn.  I could try trading for the raw iron again.
- Confirming the recipe for a bucket.  <current status>
- I will propose a trade for 2 raw iron for my cobblestone. If that fails, I will propose a trade of 1 raw iron for my cobblestone.

- My target is a bucket. I need 3 iron ingots. I have 2 iron ingots and 1 raw iron. Player 2 has 2 raw iron and 1 iron ingot.  My previous attempts to trade for iron have been unsuccessful. I need to re-evaluate my strategy.  Perhaps offering something more valuable would entice Player 2 to trade.
- Checking what I can craft with my current resources might give me alternative trading options.  <current status>
- Since direct trades for iron haven't worked, I'll try a different approach. I'll offer my 2 iron ingots for Player 2's 2 raw iron AND their iron ingot. This gives them a net gain of iron while providing me with enough to craft the bucket. If this fails, I'll offer my cobblestone and 1 iron ingot for their 2 raw iron and iron ingot.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **stick**.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket. I need 3 iron ingots. I have 2 iron ingots and 1 raw iron. Player 2 has 2 raw iron and 1 iron ingot.  My previous attempts to trade for iron have been largely unsuccessful.  I need to try a different tactic.  I'll focus on getting just enough raw iron to craft the bucket.
- Double checking how to make iron ingots from raw iron, just in case.  <current status>
- I'll offer my cobblestone for 1 raw iron. This is a smaller trade, and Player 2 might be more willing to part with a single raw iron. If this fails, I'll offer my cobblestone and raw iron for their 2 raw iron.

- First, I need to understand what a lever requires to craft and check if we have the necessary materials or need to trade for them.

- I'll offer my cobblestone for just ONE of Player 2's raw iron. This is a low-cost trade for Player 2, and it gets me closer to my goal. If that fails, I'll offer my raw iron for one of theirs.  This is an even trade, so it might be more appealing.

- Player 2 has oak planks, cobblestone, and raw copper.  They've also shown interest in coal in the past for smelting. I don't have anything they desperately need, but I can try offering something small and see if they're willing to make a minor trade.  I'll offer my raw iron for one of their raw iron. This is a neutral trade for them, but it helps me. If that fails, I'll offer my cobblestone for one of their raw iron.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:iron_ingot * 1, ], offer [minecraft:cobblestone * 1, ] together with a text message: I'd like to trade my cobblestone for your iron ingot. Let me know if you're interested.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I need to evaluate this trade proposal carefully. Player 1 wants my iron_ingot and is offering cobblestone in return. To make a good decision, I should:  1. Check what items are needed to craft a lever (our target) 2. Assess whether this trade helps or hinders our progress toward crafting a lever 3. Consider what player 1 might be trying to craft with the iron_ingot  Let me first check the recipe for a lever.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **lever**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- Now I understand that to craft a lever, I need: 1. 1 cobblestone 2. 1 stick  I already have 1 cobblestone in my hand. For the stick, I would need to use my oak_planks. Let me check the recipe for sticks.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **stick**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- Looking at the information I've gathered, I can see that to craft a lever (our target), I need: 1. 1 cobblestone 2. 1 stick  I already have 1 cobblestone in my hand, and I can craft a stick using my oak_planks (the recipe shows I can get 4 sticks from 2 planks). So I already have everything I need to craft our target item - the lever.  If I accept this trade, I would: - Give away: 1 iron_ingot - Receive: 1 cobblestone  This would give me 2 cobblestone total, but I only need 1 for the lever. The extra cobblestone doesn't help me reach my goal faster.  Meanwhile, I'd be losing an iron_ingot, which is a valuable resource that could potentially be useful for other crafting or trading.  Looking at player 1's inventory, they already have 2 iron_ingots. By giving them a third iron_ingot, I might be helping them craft something that requires 3 iron (like an iron pickaxe). This could potentially help them reach their target item before us.  Since I already have everything I need to craft our target (lever), and this trade doesn't benefit our progress, I should reject this proposal.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2 decided to reject the proposal with a text message: Thank you for the offer, but I don't need additional cobblestone at this time. I'll keep my iron_ingot for now.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket. I need 3 iron ingots to craft it. I currently have 2 iron ingots and 1 raw iron.  Player 2 has 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron. I need to get 1 more iron ingot or 2 raw iron. Trading for the iron ingot directly would be the fastest way to get the bucket.
- I'll check the recipe for a bucket again to be sure.  I also need to consider what Player 2 might be trying to craft.  They have cobblestone, oak planks, raw copper, and iron.  Perhaps they are aiming for a shield, which requires oak planks and iron ingots.  If so, they might be reluctant to trade iron.  I could offer them cobblestone, but they already have some.  Maybe raw copper would be more enticing, although I'd prefer to keep it if possible.  <current status>

I already have 1 cobblestone, and I can craft sticks using my oak_planks. So I have everything I need to craft my target item.  Looking at our inventories: - I have: cobblestone (1), iron_ingot (1), oak_planks (1), raw_copper (3), raw_iron (2) - Player 1 has: cobblestone (1), iron_ingot (2), raw_iron (1)  I notice that player 1 has tried to get more iron ingots from me in previous turns, which suggests they might need iron for their target. They currently have 2 iron ingots and 1 raw iron.  For my proposal, I could offer some of my raw_iron in exchange for something I might need as backup materials. Since I already have what I need for my lever, I could trade some raw_iron for player 1's cobblestone, which would give me an extra cobblestone in case I need it.
- On second thought, I should be careful not to give player 1 too many resources that might help them reach their target faster. Since they seem interested in iron, I should probably avoid giving them more iron-related items.  Instead, I could offer some of my raw_copper, which I have 3 of, and doesn't seem to be directly useful for my lever crafting. I could request their cobblestone, which would give me a backup cobblestone.  This trade would: 1. Not give player 1 materials they seem to want (iron) 2. Give me a backup cobblestone 3. Reduce my inventory of items I don't need (raw_copper)  I'll propose trading 1 raw_copper for 1 cobblestone.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket, which requires iron ingots.  I already have two iron ingots and one raw iron.  Raw copper isn't directly useful for my goal. Cobblestone also isn't directly useful.  Trading cobblestone for raw copper doesn't seem to help me much, but it doesn't hurt either.

- I need to confirm the recipe for a bucket.  I also want to see what Player 2 might be trying to craft. He has cobblestone, oak planks, raw copper, and iron ingot/raw iron.  He seems to be collecting raw copper, which suggests he might be aiming for a spyglass or lightning rod.  A spyglass requires copper ingots and amethyst shards, while a lightning rod requires copper ingots.
- Knowing the recipes for spyglass and lightning rod helps me understand Player 2's potential goals.  If he's going for a spyglass, he'll need amethyst shards, which I don't have. If he's aiming for a lightning rod, he'll need a lot of copper.  I should try to trade for the iron I need without giving him too much copper.  <current status>

- My target is a bucket, which requires 3 iron ingots. I currently have 2 iron ingots and 1 raw iron. Player 2 has 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron.  I need 1 more iron ingot. I can smelt my raw iron into an iron ingot, but I need fuel. Player 2 has no fuel. I need to trade for an iron ingot or fuel.
- Confirming the recipe for a bucket.
- Checking what I can craft with my current resources.  <current status>
- I can smelt my raw iron into an iron ingot if I can get fuel.  I'll propose a trade with Player 2 for either an iron ingot or some kind of fuel. I'll offer raw copper since I don't need it for my bucket.

- My target is a bucket, which requires 3 iron ingots. I currently have 2 iron ingots and 1 raw iron. Player 2 has 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron.  I need 1 more iron ingot or a way to smelt my raw iron. I tried trading for an iron ingot or fuel, but Player 2 rejected my offers.
- Reviewing how to obtain another iron ingot.
- Checking what I can craft with my current resources.  <current status>
- I still need either an iron ingot or fuel.  Since direct trades haven't worked, I'll try a different approach. I'll offer both my raw copper and raw iron for Player 2's iron ingot. This is a more valuable offer, and it might incentivize them to trade. If that doesn't work, I'll have to hope they offer me something I can use as fuel in a future turn.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- First, I need to understand what a lever is and how to craft it. Let me check the recipe for a lever.
- While waiting for the lever recipe, let me check what recipes I can currently make with my hand.
- Now I need to understand what items I have and what I need to craft a lever. Let me analyze the current game state:  My target: 1 lever My current hand: - minecraft:cobblestone: 2 - minecraft:iron_ingot: 1 - minecraft:oak_planks: 1 - minecraft:raw_copper: 2 - minecraft:raw_iron: 2  Opponent's hand: - minecraft:iron_ingot: 2 - minecraft:raw_copper: 1 - minecraft:raw_iron: 1  I need to check if I have the necessary ingredients to craft a lever or what I need to trade for.
- I need to understand all the components needed for crafting a lever. Let me check the recipe for a stick since it might be a component.
- Based on Minecraft crafting knowledge, a lever typically requires 1 stick and 1 cobblestone. I already have 2 cobblestone, so I have enough of that. For a stick, I need to craft it from planks. I have 1 oak_planks, which should be enough to craft sticks. Let me verify this with the recipe information.  Let me check what recipes I can make with my current hand again to confirm.
- I need to be very specific about the crafting recipes. Let me check the exact recipe for a lever to make sure I understand the requirements correctly.
- I think I have a good plan.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket, which requires 3 iron ingots. I currently have 2 iron ingots and 1 raw iron. Player 2 has 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron.  I need 1 more iron ingot or a way to smelt my raw iron.  My previous attempts to trade for an iron ingot or fuel have failed. Player 2 seems reluctant to part with their iron ingot.
- Reviewing how to obtain another iron ingot.  I need to consider alternatives if trading doesn't work.
- Checking what I can craft with my current resources, although I suspect I can't do much without fuel or another iron ingot.  <current status>
- I'm going to make one last attempt to trade for the iron ingot. I'll offer both my raw copper and raw iron again. If this fails, I'll focus on trying to acquire fuel in the hopes that Player 2 will eventually trade for an iron ingot or I can craft something they need and trade for it.  It's a long shot, but it's my best option at this point.

- Checking what I can craft with my current resources, although I suspect I can't do much without fuel or another iron ingot.  <current status>
- Since Player 2 has oak planks and cobblestone, they might be aiming for crafting tools or other items that require more iron.  I'll try a different tactic. I'll offer my raw copper and raw iron, but this time, I'll ask for one of their raw iron instead of the iron ingot. This might be more appealing to them if they are planning to smelt their own iron ingots. If I can get one raw iron, I can smelt it along with my own raw iron if I can acquire fuel later.

- I'm going to make one last, more significant offer. I'll offer both my raw copper, raw iron, *and* one of my iron ingots for their single iron ingot. This is a 2-for-1 deal on iron, plus the copper. It's a substantial offer, and it might be enough to convince them. If this fails, I'll have to shift my strategy entirely and focus on acquiring fuel and hoping they become more willing to trade later or I can craft something they need.

Since I need another oak plank, I should consider what I can offer that would be valuable to player 1.  Player 1 has been trying to get iron ingots from me in previous turns, so they might be working toward something that requires iron.

- I need to make a proposal to trade with player 1. To craft a lever, I need 1 cobblestone and 1 stick. I already have 2 cobblestone, but I need to craft a stick from my oak planks. I have 1 oak planks, but the recipe requires 2 oak planks to make 4 sticks.  Looking at what player 1 has: - 2 iron_ingot - 1 raw_copper - 1 raw_iron  And what I have: - 2 cobblestone - 1 iron_ingot - 1 oak_planks - 2 raw_copper - 2 raw_iron  I should try to get more oak planks or another type of planks to craft sticks. Let me see if I can make a trade that would help me get closer to my goal.  Since player 1 doesn't have any planks, I'll need to focus on getting resources that might help me in other ways. I could offer some of my raw materials in exchange for something that might be useful.  I'll propose trading some of my raw_copper for one of player 1's iron_ingot. This could potentially help me craft other useful items later.
- Looking at the game history, I notice that player 1 has been trying to get more iron ingots, likely to craft a bucket which requires 3 iron ingots. They currently have 2 iron ingots and need 1 more.  I need to craft a lever, which requires 1 cobblestone and 1 stick. I have 2 cobblestone already, but I need to craft a stick from planks. I have 1 oak plank, but need more planks to craft sticks.  For my proposal, I'll offer something player 1 might want (raw materials) in exchange for something that might help me. Since player 1 doesn't have planks to offer, I'll focus on getting other useful resources.  I'll propose trading some of my raw_copper for one of player 1's raw_iron. This keeps me from giving away my iron ingot (which player 1 wants) while still making a reasonable trade.

- I'll try one last time to trade for the iron ingot. Since he wants raw iron, I'll offer him my 2 raw copper for his 1 iron ingot and 1 raw iron. This gives him more of what he seems to want, and I get the iron ingot I need to complete the bucket. If this fails, I'll have to shift my strategy and consider how I can help *him* get what *he* needs, so he'll be more willing to trade with me.

- Since direct trades for the iron ingot haven't worked, I need to think strategically.  What can I offer Player 2 that would genuinely benefit him, making him more inclined to trade? He has oak planks, which could be used for various crafting recipes.  Maybe he's aiming for sticks, slabs, or even a crafting table.  I'll try offering him something he might need for those, like raw copper, in exchange for the iron ingot.
- This will give me information about what can be crafted with oak planks, helping me understand Player 2's potential crafting goals.

He might be trying to craft shears (2 iron ingots), an iron block (9 iron ingots), or something involving oak planks (sticks, slabs, crafting table, etc.).  Since he's been collecting raw copper, I'll offer him all my raw copper for his iron ingot, emphasizing that it could help him reach his crafting goals faster.  If this fails, I'll need to consider more complex strategies, like helping him acquire specific items he might need for his suspected target.

The oak button suggests he might be working towards something more complex that requires buttons as components.  I'll offer him all my raw copper for his iron ingot one last time, with a clear message explaining my need. If this fails, I'll shift my focus to helping him achieve *his* goal, even if it means delaying my own.  This might involve trading for items he seems to need, like raw iron, or crafting intermediate items that could be useful to him.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- To craft a lever, I need 1 cobblestone and 1 stick. I already have 2 cobblestone, but I need to craft a stick. According to the recipe, I can craft 4 sticks from 2 planks. I currently have 1 oak_planks, which I can use to craft sticks.  Looking at my opponent's inventory, they have 2 iron_ingots and 2 raw_copper. I have 1 raw_copper and 3 raw_iron. Since I'm focused on crafting a lever, I don't immediately need more iron or copper, but I could potentially trade some of my raw_iron for something else that might be useful.  I notice that player 1 has been repeatedly asking for iron to craft a bucket (which requires 3 iron ingots). They currently have 2 iron ingots, so they need 1 more. I could trade 1 of my raw_iron for something useful.  Since I already have the cobblestone I need for the lever, and I can craft sticks from my oak_planks, I don't need anything specific from player 1. However, I could trade 1 raw_iron for 1 raw_copper, which might be useful for future crafting or trading.  My proposal looks good now.

I need 3 iron ingots to make a bucket. I need to trade for another iron ingot or find a way to smelt my raw iron into an iron ingot.  I could offer Player 2 raw copper for raw iron, then smelt the raw iron into an iron ingot.
- I need to confirm the recipe for a bucket.  I also want to see what Player 2 might be trying to craft. He seems interested in trading raw materials, so maybe he's trying to craft something basic.  He traded for cobblestone earlier, so maybe something related to that?  He also has oak planks and an oak button.
- A lever requires a cobblestone and a stick.  He has cobblestone, and sticks are made from planks, which he also has.  It's possible he's aiming for a lever.  Knowing this might help me in trading.  <current status>

I can either try to trade for it or smelt my raw iron and raw copper into ingots.  Smelting raw iron into an iron ingot requires fuel, which I don't have.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- To craft a lever, I need 1 cobblestone and 1 stick. I already have 2 cobblestone, but I need to craft a stick. Sticks are crafted from planks. I currently have an oak_button, which is made from oak_planks, but I need the actual planks to make sticks.  Looking at my inventory, I have: - 2 cobblestone (enough for the lever) - 1 oak_button (not directly useful for lever) - 1 iron_ingot - 2 raw_copper - 2 raw_iron  Looking at player 1's inventory: - 2 iron_ingot - 1 raw_copper - 1 raw_iron  I need to get oak_planks to craft sticks. Since I don't have oak_planks directly, I should try to trade for them. However, player 1 doesn't appear to have oak_planks either.  Let me check if I can convert the oak_button back to planks.

Since I don't have oak_planks directly, I should try to trade for them. However, player 1 doesn't appear to have oak_planks either.  Since neither of us has oak_planks, I need to make a strategic trade that might help me in future turns. I notice that player 1 has been repeatedly asking for my iron_ingot, likely to craft a bucket (which requires 3 iron ingots). I could use this as leverage.  I'll propose trading one of my raw_copper for one of player 1's raw_iron. This would give me more raw_iron to potentially smelt into iron ingots later, while giving player 1 more raw_copper which they seem to be collecting.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
