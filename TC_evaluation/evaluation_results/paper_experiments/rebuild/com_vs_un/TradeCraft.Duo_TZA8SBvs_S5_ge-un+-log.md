## 🌀 Turn 1 start!
----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I need to acquire more iron to craft chain. My opponent has a lot of raw iron, which I can smelt into iron ingots. I also have coal, which is needed for smelting.  I can offer them some of my resources in exchange.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **chain**.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I need 2 iron ingots to craft a chain. I already have one, so I need one more.  Since my opponent has a lot of raw iron, I can offer them coal to smelt it, and request some iron ingots in return. I'll offer them a 1:1 trade of coal for raw iron, and request 1 iron ingot.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:iron_ingot * 1, ], offer [minecraft:coal * 1, ] together with a text message: I have coal and you have raw iron. I'm willing to trade you coal for raw iron at a 1:1 ratio. I also need an iron ingot, and I'm hoping we can work out a trade for that as well. Let me know what you think.


### 🖥 Server Event: `server__proposal_invalid`
player 1's proposal is INVALID according to the game rule.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I need iron ingots to make a chain. My opponent has raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots. I can offer them coal to smelt the raw iron, and request an iron ingot in return.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **chain**.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I need iron ingots to make a chain. My opponent has raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots. I can offer them coal, which they can use as fuel to smelt their raw iron.  I'll request an iron ingot in return. Since they have 5 raw iron, offering one coal for one iron ingot seems like a fair trade.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:iron_ingot * 1, ], offer [minecraft:coal * 1, ] together with a text message: I have coal, which you can use to smelt your raw iron. I need an iron ingot to craft a chain. Would you be willing to trade one iron ingot for one coal?


### 🖥 Server Event: `server__proposal_invalid`
player 1's proposal is INVALID according to the game rule.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I need to figure out how to craft a chain.  I'll use the item_info tool to get the recipe.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **chain**.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- Okay, I need 1 iron ingot and 2 iron nuggets to make a chain. I already have 1 iron ingot.  I can try to trade my coal for raw iron, and then smelt the raw iron into an iron ingot, and then craft iron nuggets from the iron ingot. My opponent has 5 raw iron, so I'll try to trade for some of that.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **iron_nugget**.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I will offer my coal since I don't need it for the chain. I'll request 2 raw iron from my opponent. That should be enough to make the additional iron ingot I need, and then the iron nuggets.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:coal * 1, ] together with a text message: I need some raw iron to help me craft something.  Would you be willing to trade 2 raw iron for my coal?


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a lever.  A lever requires a cobblestone and a stick. I already have cobblestone.  Sticks can be crafted from planks. I have oak planks, so I can make sticks.  Trading raw iron for coal doesn't directly help me achieve my goal.  However, player 1 wants raw iron, which suggests they might be trying to craft something involving iron.  Giving them iron could help them progress towards their goal, which is not ideal.  Coal can be used as fuel in a furnace, but I don't currently need fuel.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **lever**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- Confirming that a lever needs cobblestone and a stick. I have both ingredients available (cobblestone and oak planks to make sticks).  I don't need the coal.  It's better to hold onto my raw iron and not help my opponent.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2 decided to reject the proposal with a text message: I don't need coal right now.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a lever, which requires a stick and cobblestone. I have the cobblestone, but I need a stick.  Sticks are crafted from planks, and I have one oak plank.  This is enough to make the lever.  My opponent rejected my trade offer for coal, but I don't need it right now. I should focus on crafting the lever.  <current status>
- I will craft sticks from my oak plank, then craft the lever using the stick and cobblestone.
- I'm checking possible recipes to confirm I can craft sticks and then the lever.
- Confirming the stick recipe.
- Confirming the lever recipe.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a lever, which requires a stick and cobblestone. I have both items in my hand. My opponent rejected my trade offer for coal, but I don't need it right now. I should focus on crafting the lever immediately.  <current status>
- I will craft the lever using the stick and cobblestone I already possess.
- Confirming the lever recipe one last time.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is 1 chain. I have cherry planks, coal, cobblestone, iron ingot, and raw copper. My opponent has cobblestone, oak planks, raw copper, and raw iron.  I need 2 iron ingots and 1 chain to craft a chain. I currently have 1 iron ingot. I tried to trade coal for iron ingot, but the opponent rejected.  I need to find another way to get iron ingot. Since the opponent has a lot of raw iron, maybe I can trade for that and smelt it into iron ingot.
- I'll check the recipe for iron ingot again to make sure.  I also need to figure out how much raw iron I need to trade for.  <current status>
- I can smelt raw iron into iron ingots. I need one more iron ingot.  I'll try to trade for 2 raw iron from the opponent, since smelting 2 raw iron will give me 2 iron ingots, and I can keep the extra one for future use. I'll offer my cobblestone since I don't need it for my current plan.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a lever, which requires a stick and cobblestone. I have the cobblestone, but I need a stick.  Sticks are crafted from planks, and I have one oak plank.  This is enough to make the lever. My opponent rejected my trade for coal, but that's fine, I don't need it for the lever.  <current status>
- I will craft sticks from my oak plank, then craft the lever using the stick and cobblestone.
- Checking the stick recipe to make sure I have the correct input and output amounts.
- Double checking the lever recipe.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is 1 chain. I have cherry planks, coal, cobblestone, iron ingot, and raw copper. My opponent has cobblestone, oak planks, raw copper, and raw iron. I need 2 iron ingots to craft a chain. I currently have 1 iron ingot. My previous trade offer for an iron ingot was rejected.  Since the opponent has a lot of raw iron, I can try to trade for that and smelt it into iron ingots.
- I can smelt raw iron into iron ingots using a furnace and fuel. I need one more iron ingot.  I'll try to trade for 2 raw iron from the opponent. Smelting 2 raw iron will give me 2 iron ingots. I'll offer my cobblestone since I don't need it for my current plan. I'll also offer a small amount of coal as fuel for the opponent, as an incentive.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a lever, which requires a stick and cobblestone. I have the cobblestone, but I need a stick.  Sticks are crafted from planks, and I have one oak plank.  This is enough to make the lever. My opponent rejected my trade for coal, but that's fine, I don't need it for the lever.  <current status>

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a lever. I have the cobblestone, and I have an oak plank to make sticks.  I don't need to trade.  <current status>
- Craft sticks from the plank, then the lever.
- Confirming stick recipe.
- Confirming lever recipe.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is 1 chain. I have cherry planks, coal, cobblestone, iron ingot, and raw copper. My opponent has cobblestone, oak planks, raw copper, and raw iron. I need 2 iron ingots to craft a chain. I currently have 1 iron ingot. My previous trade offers were rejected.  Since the opponent has a lot of raw iron, I can try to trade for that and smelt it into iron ingots. I need to make the trade more appealing to the opponent.
- I can smelt raw iron into iron ingots using a furnace and fuel. I need one more iron ingot.  I'll try to trade for 2 raw iron from the opponent. Smelting 2 raw iron will give me 2 iron ingots. I'll offer my cobblestone and a larger portion of my coal (0.25, which is enough to smelt both raw iron) as fuel for the opponent, as an incentive. This should make the trade more attractive.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **stick**.


### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__craft_recipe_check`
player 2 check the validity of the recipe: Input [oak_planks * 1, ], Output [stick * 2, ], the recipe is invalid


### 🖥 Server Event: `server__craft_recipe_validity`

Currently, his/her hand crafts change to: [minecraft:cobblestone * 1, minecraft:oak_planks * 1, minecraft:raw_copper * 2, minecraft:raw_iron * 5, ]


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is 1 chain. I have cherry planks, coal, cobblestone, iron ingot, and raw copper. My opponent has cobblestone, oak planks, raw copper, and raw iron. I need 2 iron ingots to craft a chain. I currently have 1 iron ingot. My previous trade offers were rejected.  Since the opponent has a lot of raw iron, I can try to trade for that and smelt it into iron ingots. I need to make the trade more appealing to the opponent. Perhaps they need fuel.
- I can smelt raw iron into iron ingots using a furnace and fuel. I need one more iron ingot.  I'll try to trade for 2 raw iron from the opponent. Smelting 2 raw iron will give me 2 iron ingots. I'll offer my cobblestone and half of my coal (0.5) as fuel for the opponent. This is a significant amount of fuel and should make the trade much more attractive. I'll emphasize the fuel aspect in my message.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is 1 chain. I have cherry planks, coal, cobblestone, iron ingot, and raw copper. My opponent has cobblestone, oak planks, raw copper, and raw iron. I need 2 iron ingots to craft a chain. I currently have 1 iron ingot. My previous trade offers were rejected. Since the opponent has a lot of raw iron, I can try to trade for that and smelt it into iron ingots. I need to make the trade appealing.  Maybe offering almost all my coal will incentivize them.
- I can smelt raw iron into iron ingots using a furnace and fuel. I need one more iron ingot.  I'll try to trade for 2 raw iron from the opponent. Smelting 2 raw iron will give me 2 iron ingots. I'll offer my cobblestone and most of my coal (0.75) as fuel for the opponent. This is a very generous offer and should be hard to refuse.

## 🌀 Turn 2 start!
----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I need a lever.  Let's see how to craft it. I also need to consider what player 1 might need and how I can make a proposal that benefits me without benefiting them too much.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **lever**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I need cobblestone and stick. I have cobblestone.  Now I need to figure out how to get a stick.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **stick**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I have oak planks, so I can make sticks.  Since player 1 has iron ingots, they might be trying to make rails, which require sticks. I'll offer them a small amount of oak planks for their iron ingot. This could help me get sticks without giving them too much of what they might need.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [iron_ingot * 1, ], offer [oak_planks * 1, ] together with a text message: I noticed you have iron ingots. I have some extra oak planks if you'd be willing to trade for one of your ingots.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a chain.  A chain requires 2 iron ingots and 1 iron nuggets. I currently have 1 iron ingot. Trading it away would put me further away from my goal.  Oak planks are not directly useful for crafting a chain.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1 decided to reject the proposal with a text message: I need the iron ingot to craft other items.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a lever. I need a stick and a cobblestone. I have the cobblestone, but I need a stick.  Sticks are crafted from planks, and I have one oak plank.  My opponent rejected my trade offer for their iron ingot, which I could have used to make more efficient trades. I need to rethink my trading strategy.
- Let's see what I can craft with what I have.  I should be able to make a stick from my oak plank.  <current status>
- I have enough materials to craft a lever now. I should craft it and win the game.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a chain. I need 2 iron ingots and 1 iron nugget to craft it. I currently have 1 iron ingot. My opponent has 5 raw iron, which can be smelted into 5 iron ingots. I need to trade for at least 1 more iron ingot or some raw iron.  I offered coal for an iron ingot last turn, but they rejected it. They then offered oak planks for my iron ingot, which I rejected.  I need to find a trade they will accept.
- I'll check the recipe for chain again to make sure I'm not missing anything.  I also need to consider what my opponent might be crafting.  With raw iron, cobblestone, and oak planks, they could be trying to make stone tools, or perhaps shears.
- Seeing what I can craft from my current hand might give me some trading ideas.  Perhaps there's something I can offer that would be more appealing to my opponent.  <current status>
- I need to acquire more iron.  Since my opponent has a lot of raw iron, maybe they need fuel for smelting. I don't have any coal, but I do have cherry planks, which can be used as fuel.  I could offer some cherry planks in exchange for raw iron.
- Another possibility is that my opponent is aiming for shears, which requires 2 iron ingots.  If that's the case, they might be willing to trade some raw iron for something else.  I could try offering my copper ingot, as they only have raw copper.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a lever. I have the cobblestone and enough oak planks to make a stick. I should craft the lever now.  My opponent rejected my previous trade offer for their iron ingot. I'll need to consider what their target might be and how I can disrupt their progress in future turns.  They seem interested in raw iron.
- I have confirmed I can craft the stick and then the lever.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a lever. I have the cobblestone and oak planks to make a stick. I should craft the lever now. My opponent rejected my previous trade offer for their iron ingot. I'll need to consider what their target might be and how I can disrupt their progress in future turns. They seem interested in raw iron, so perhaps their target requires it.
- I've confirmed I can craft the stick and then the lever.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a chain. I need 2 iron ingots and 1 iron nugget to craft it. I currently have 1 iron ingot. My opponent has 5 raw iron, which can be smelted into 5 iron ingots. I need to trade for at least 1 more iron ingot or enough raw iron (2) to make another ingot.  I offered coal for an iron ingot last turn, but they rejected it. They then offered oak planks for my iron ingot, which I rejected.  I need to find a trade they will accept.  They seem to want iron, so offering my only iron ingot is probably not a good strategy.
- Double checking the recipe for a chain.
- Checking what I can craft might spark some trading ideas.  <current status>
- My opponent has a lot of raw iron, so they might need fuel for smelting. I have cherry planks, which can be used as fuel.  Offering a small amount of planks for raw iron might be a good trade.  They also have oak planks, so they might not value planks as much.  I also have a copper ingot, which they might want since they only have raw copper.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:

They then offered oak planks for my iron ingot, which I rejected.  I need to find a trade they will accept.  They seem to want iron, so offering my only iron ingot is probably not a good strategy.  I need to offer something they need while trying to conserve my resources.

- Checking what I can craft might spark some trading ideas.  <current status>
- My opponent has a lot of raw iron, so they might need fuel for smelting. I have cherry planks, which can be used as fuel.  Offering a small amount of planks for raw iron might be a good trade.  They also have oak planks, so they might not value planks as much, but they might need a different type of wood for crafting something specific. I also have a copper ingot, which they might want since they only have raw copper.  They have cobblestone as well, so they might be aiming for stone tools.  I should prioritize getting the raw iron I need.  Offering too much for the raw iron might hurt me in the long run.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a lever, which requires a stick and cobblestone. I already have cobblestone.  Sticks can be crafted from planks, and I have oak planks.  Therefore, I don't need copper or iron.  Trading away raw iron might hinder player 1's progress if their target requires it.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **lever**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- Confirming that a lever needs cobblestone and a stick. I have the cobblestone.  I have oak planks, which can be made into sticks.  I don't need the copper ingot.  Trading away the raw iron might slow down player 1 if their target needs it. It's a good trade for me.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Sounds good.  I'll trade you.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a lever. I need a stick and a cobblestone. I have a cobblestone. I need a stick.  A stick can be crafted from planks. I have oak planks.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a chain. I need 2 iron ingots and 1 iron nugget to craft it. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron.  My opponent has 3 raw iron. I need to acquire more iron in some way.
- Reviewing the recipe for chain to confirm requirements.  <current status>
- I need another iron ingot and an iron nugget. I could smelt my 2 raw iron into 2 iron ingots, then craft an iron nugget from an ingot.  Alternatively, I could trade for more raw iron or an iron ingot from my opponent. They have 3 raw iron.
- I'll try trading for 1 raw iron from my opponent. I can offer them my cobblestone since I don't need it for my current plan.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a chain. I need 2 iron ingots and 1 iron nugget to craft it. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron.  My opponent has 3 raw iron. I successfully traded my copper ingot for 2 of their raw iron. Now I have enough to craft the chain.
- Double checking the chain recipe to be absolutely sure.  <current status>
- I have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron. I'll smelt the raw iron into ingots, then craft a nugget from one of the ingots, and finally craft the chain.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a lever. I have the cobblestone and oak planks needed to craft one. The opponent traded their copper ingot for my raw iron in the last turn. They seem to be focused on acquiring iron.  I have enough materials to craft the lever now.  <current status>
- I will craft a stick from the oak planks, then craft a lever using the stick and cobblestone. I will then be done crafting. Since I only have one oak plank, I will only get 2 sticks, but I only need one for the lever.
- Confirming available recipes given my current hand.  I should be able to craft sticks and then the lever.
- Double checking the stick recipe to make sure I have the correct plank type and amount.
- Double checking the lever recipe.
