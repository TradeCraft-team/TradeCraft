## 🌀 Turn 1 start!
----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a chain.  I need iron ingots for that. I already have one iron ingot. My opponent has a lot of raw iron. I should try to trade for some of that raw iron. I also need fuel for smelting the raw iron. I have coal, which is a good fuel source.  I'll offer some of my less useful items like cherry planks and cobblestone in exchange for the raw iron.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **chain**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I need two iron ingots or one iron ingot and two iron nuggets to make a chain.  Since my opponent has raw iron, I'll request that.  I'll offer cobblestone and cherry planks, which are less useful to me right now.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **lever**.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
