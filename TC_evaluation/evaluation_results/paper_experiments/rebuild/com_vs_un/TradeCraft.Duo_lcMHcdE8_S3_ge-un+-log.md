## üåÄ Turn 1 start!
----------------------------------------

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I need to acquire iron ingots to craft a bucket.  My opponent has a lot of raw iron. I can offer them coal to smelt it, and request some of the resulting iron ingots in return.  I'll also see if they'll trade raw copper for cobblestone since I have an extra cobblestone.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **bucket**.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I need 3 iron ingots to make a bucket.  I have one, so I need two more.  I'll offer coal and cobblestone and ask for two iron ingots and one raw copper.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:iron_ingot * 2, minecraft:raw_copper * 1, ], offer [minecraft:coal * 1, minecraft:cobblestone * 1, ] together with a text message: I have coal you can use to smelt your raw iron.  I'd like to trade my coal and cobblestone for two iron ingots and one raw copper.  Let me know if you're interested.


### üñ• Server Event: `server__proposal_invalid`
player 1's proposal is INVALID according to the game rule.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I need to acquire iron ingots to craft a bucket. My opponent has raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots. I can offer them coal, which they'll need for smelting. I also need more raw copper.  I will offer them cobblestone for raw copper. Since they have more raw copper than I do, they might be willing to trade.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **bucket**.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I need 3 iron ingots to craft a bucket. My opponent has 5 raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots. I can offer them coal, which they'll need for smelting. I will offer them cobblestone, which they might need, in exchange for raw copper. Since they have more raw copper than I do, they might be willing to trade. I will request 2 raw iron from them, hoping they will agree to trade since they have 5.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:coal * 1, minecraft:cobblestone * 1, ] together with a text message: I need iron to make a bucket.  I have coal you can use to smelt your raw iron. I'll also give you cobblestone for some of your raw copper. Let me know if you're interested in trading.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- They are offering coal and cobblestone for my raw iron.  Coal is essential for smelting the raw iron into iron ingots, which I'll need for the lever.  Cobblestone isn't directly useful for my goal, but it could be useful as a building material if I need it later.  They claim they need the iron for a bucket. A bucket requires three iron ingots, so they likely already have at least one.  It seems like a fair trade, as I get the fuel I need, but I need to consider if this trade benefits them more than it benefits me.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **lever**.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- I need cobblestone and sticks to make a lever.  This trade gives me cobblestone. I already have enough raw iron to make several levers, so giving up two isn't a big loss, especially if I get coal in return.  Accepting the trade gets me closer to my goal.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Sounds good.  I could use the coal.


### üñ• Server Event: `server__update_all_hands`
Server updated all hands:
player 1 hand: [minecraft:cherry_planks * 1, minecraft:iron_ingot * 1, minecraft:raw_copper * 1, minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ]
player 2 hand: [minecraft:coal * 1, minecraft:cobblestone * 2, minecraft:oak_planks * 1, minecraft:raw_copper * 2, minecraft:raw_iron * 3, ]


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket. I need 3 iron ingots to craft it. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron.  player 2 has 3 raw iron. I need to obtain 1 more iron ingot or 1 more raw iron to craft a bucket. I also have cherry planks which can be used as fuel to smelt raw iron.
- I confirmed that a bucket requires 3 iron ingots.  I need to smelt my 2 raw iron into iron ingots.
- I can smelt raw iron using my cherry planks as fuel.  <current status>
- I will smelt my 2 raw iron into 2 iron ingots. This will give me a total of 3 iron ingots, enough to craft a bucket.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a lever. I need a cobblestone and a stick. I have 2 cobblestones. I need to craft a stick.  I traded for coal last turn, which I can use to smelt my raw iron and then craft an iron ingot. I can use the iron ingot to craft a lever or trade it for a stick.  Player 1 traded for raw iron, so they might be trying to make a bucket or other iron tools. They offered cobblestone and coal, which suggests they might have more of those resources.
- Let's see what I can craft with what I have.  <current status>
- Based on the available recipes, I can smelt my raw iron into iron ingots using the coal I received. Then, I can use the iron ingot to craft a lever directly with the cobblestone I have.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket. I need 3 iron ingots to craft it. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron. player 2 has 3 raw iron.  I traded coal and cobblestone for 2 raw iron. I need to smelt my raw iron into iron ingots. I have cherry planks which can be used as fuel.
- I confirmed that smelting raw iron requires fuel. Cherry planks can be used as fuel.  <current status>

I also have raw copper, which I could potentially use for trading.
- Let's see what I can craft with what I have. I should prioritize smelting the raw iron since that's a step towards both crafting a lever directly with iron or making a trade for a stick.  <current status>
- I will review the possible recipes and choose the most efficient path to crafting a lever.

## üåÄ Turn 2 start!
----------------------------------------

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a lever.  A lever requires a stick and cobblestone. I already have cobblestone.  Sticks can be crafted from planks. I have oak planks, so I can make sticks.  I should avoid giving my opponent materials that will help them craft a lever.  They seem to be focused on iron, so I'll try to request iron in return for something they might not need, like raw copper.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **lever**.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- I have enough cobblestone, and I can make sticks from my oak planks. I don't need anything from my opponent to make a lever.  Offering raw copper might tempt them, and requesting iron ingots could slow them down if they are trying to make a bucket or other iron tools.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:iron_ingot * 1, ], offer [minecraft:raw_copper * 1, ] together with a text message: I have some extra copper if you're interested.  I'm looking for iron ingots.  Let me know if you'd like to trade.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a bucket.  Buckets require iron ingots. Trading away an iron ingot seems counterproductive. However, to make a bucket, I need 3 iron ingots. I currently have 2.  If I trade 1 iron ingot for 1 raw copper, I will have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw copper.  I need more iron ingots.  Let me check the recipes for iron ingots.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **iron_ingot**.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I need iron ingots to make a bucket. Trading one away puts me further from my goal. I should reject this trade.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1 decided to reject the proposal with a text message: I need to hold onto my iron ingots. Thanks for the offer though.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is `minecraft:bucket`.  The opponent rejected my trade offer for their iron ingots. I need to figure out how to get more iron. I currently have 3 iron ingots, but I need 3 more to craft a bucket.  I also have some raw iron, but I need coal to smelt it.  The opponent has 1 raw iron and 2 iron ingots.  They claimed they needed iron for a bucket, so they are likely also targeting a bucket. I need to consider if I should try to trade for their raw iron or if I should focus on getting coal.
- Let's see what I can craft with what I have.  I might be able to make something useful to trade.  <current status>
- Based on the possible recipes, I can smelt my raw iron if I can get coal.  I can also try to trade for more raw iron.  My opponent might be willing to trade raw iron for raw copper since they only have 1 raw iron.
- I will try to trade 1 raw copper for their 1 raw iron. This way, I will have 4 raw iron in total. If I can get 1 coal, I can smelt them into 4 iron ingots, and with the 3 iron ingots I already have, I will have 7 iron ingots in total. Then I can craft a bucket and still have 1 iron ingot left.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is minecraft:iron_pickaxe. I have 2 minecraft:iron_ingot, 1 minecraft:raw_copper, and 1 minecraft:raw_iron.  The opponent has 2 minecraft:cobblestone, 3 minecraft:iron_ingot, 1 minecraft:oak_planks, and 2 minecraft:raw_copper. I need 3 minecraft:iron_ingot and 2 sticks to craft an iron pickaxe. I can craft sticks from planks, and I can get planks from logs.  I currently have no planks or logs. My opponent has oak planks, but I'd rather not trade for them if I can avoid it. I need one more iron ingot.
- I'm checking the recipe for iron_pickaxe again to make sure I have it right. I also want to see if there are any alternative ways to get one.
- I want to see what I can craft with what I have right now. Maybe I can make something useful.  <current status>
- I need to get another iron ingot.  My opponent has 3, so trading seems like the best option. I can offer them my raw copper since I don't need it for my pickaxe.
- I also need to get planks or logs to make sticks.  Since my opponent has oak planks, I could try to trade for those.  However, I might be able to smelt my raw iron into an iron ingot and then trade that for both the planks and the extra iron ingot I need.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is `minecraft:bucket`. The opponent rejected my last trade offer for their iron ingots, stating they needed them. This reinforces my suspicion that they are also trying to craft a bucket. I have 3 iron ingots and 2 raw iron.  They have 2 iron ingots and 1 raw iron. I need 3 more iron ingots to craft the bucket.  I need to acquire more iron, either through trading or by smelting my raw iron, which requires coal.
- I need to see what I can craft with my current resources. This will help me identify any potential trading opportunities or alternative crafting paths.  <current status>
- I can smelt my raw iron if I get coal.  Trading for more raw iron is also an option. Since my opponent only has 1 raw iron, they might be willing to trade it for something else, perhaps raw copper, as they have only 1.  However, given they rejected my previous offer, they are likely prioritizing iron.  I need to make a trade offer that benefits them while also helping me progress.  They have cherry planks, which could be used as fuel, but it's not very efficient.
- I will offer them 2 raw copper for their 1 raw iron and 1 cherry plank. This gives them a small amount of fuel and more copper, which they might need for something else.  If they accept, I will have 3 raw iron.  I will then attempt to trade for coal. If I can get at least 1 coal, I can smelt all my raw iron into iron ingots.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is minecraft:iron_pickaxe. I have 2 minecraft:iron_ingot, 1 minecraft:raw_copper, and 1 minecraft:raw_iron.  The opponent has 2 minecraft:cobblestone, 3 minecraft:iron_ingot, 1 minecraft:oak_planks, and 2 minecraft:raw_copper. I need 3 minecraft:iron_ingot and 2 sticks to craft an iron pickaxe.  Sticks are crafted from planks (2 planks = 4 sticks).  My opponent has oak planks, which I could trade for.
- Double checking the recipe for an iron pickaxe and exploring any alternative crafting routes.
- Evaluating what I can craft with my current resources.  <current status>
- My primary goal is to secure the third iron ingot and the oak planks. Trading my raw iron for both seems efficient. If that fails, I'll offer the raw copper for just the iron ingot.  If I can't get the planks this turn, I'll need to consider alternative strategies for acquiring wood next turn.  Perhaps trading for logs would be more appealing to the opponent.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is `minecraft:bucket`. The opponent rejected my last trade offer, indicating they are likely also aiming for a bucket. I have 3 iron ingots and 2 raw iron. They have 2 iron ingots and 1 raw iron. I need 3 more iron ingots to craft the bucket.  Acquiring more iron, either through trading or smelting my raw iron (which requires coal), is crucial.  They have cherry planks, a less efficient fuel source.
- Before proposing another trade, I need to re-evaluate what I can craft with my current resources.  <current status>
- I can smelt my raw iron if I get coal. Trading for more raw iron is also an option.  Since my opponent likely needs iron for a bucket, trading for their raw iron might be difficult.  Offering something they might need for other crafts could be more effective.  They have cherry planks, which suggests they might be working towards something wooden.  Perhaps offering cobblestone for their raw iron and a cherry plank would be more enticing.
- I will offer them 2 cobblestone for their 1 raw iron and 1 cherry plank. This gives them a resource they might need for other crafting recipes while also providing me with the iron I need. If they accept, I will have 3 raw iron. I will then attempt to trade for coal. If I get the coal, I can smelt all my raw iron into iron ingots.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is minecraft:iron_pickaxe. I have 2 minecraft:iron_ingot, 1 minecraft:raw_copper, and 1 minecraft:raw_iron.  The opponent has 2 minecraft:cobblestone, 3 minecraft:iron_ingot, 1 minecraft:oak_planks, and 2 minecraft:raw_copper. I need 3 minecraft:iron_ingot and 2 sticks to craft an iron pickaxe.  Sticks are crafted from planks (2 planks = 4 sticks, so 1 plank = 2 sticks).  My opponent has oak planks, which I could trade for. I need 1 more iron ingot and 1 oak plank.
- Double checking the recipe for an iron pickaxe and exploring any alternative crafting routes.
- Evaluating what I can craft with my current resources.  <current status>
- My primary goal is to secure the third iron ingot and the oak planks. Trading my raw iron for both seems efficient. If that fails, I'll offer the raw copper for just the iron ingot and try to trade for the plank next turn.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is `minecraft:bucket`. The opponent rejected my last trade offer, likely because they also need iron for a bucket. I have 3 iron ingots and 2 raw iron. They have 2 iron ingots and 1 raw iron. I need 3 more iron ingots to craft the bucket. Acquiring more iron, either through trading or smelting my raw iron (which requires coal), is crucial. They have cherry planks, a less efficient fuel source.  I have 2 cobblestone, which they might need for tools or furnaces.
- Before proposing another trade, I need to re-evaluate what I can craft with my current resources.  <current status>
- I can smelt my raw iron if I get coal. Trading for more raw iron is also an option.  Since my opponent likely needs iron for a bucket, trading for their raw iron might be difficult. Offering something they might need for other crafts could be more effective.  They have cherry planks, which suggests they might be working towards something wooden.  Perhaps offering cobblestone for their raw iron and a cherry plank would be more enticing.  However, I also need to consider that offering cobblestone might help them build a furnace, which would allow them to smelt their own raw iron.
- I will offer them 1 cobblestone for their 1 raw iron. This is a simpler trade and focuses on the key resource I need. If they accept, I will have 3 raw iron and 1 cobblestone left. I will then attempt to trade for coal. If I get the coal, I can smelt all my raw iron into iron ingots. If they refuse, I will offer 2 cobblestone for their raw iron and cherry planks.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- Double checking the recipe for an iron pickaxe and exploring any alternative crafting routes.

- My primary goal is to secure the third iron ingot and the oak planks. Trading my raw iron for both seems efficient. If that fails, I'll prioritize getting the iron ingot first, then the plank.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is `minecraft:bucket`. The opponent rejected my last trade offer, likely because they also need iron for a bucket. I have 3 iron ingots and 2 raw iron. They have 2 iron ingots and 1 raw iron. I need 3 more iron ingots to craft the bucket. Acquiring more iron, either through trading or smelting my raw iron (which requires coal), is crucial. They have cherry planks, a less efficient fuel source.  I have 2 cobblestone, which they might need for tools or furnaces.  I also have 1 coal and 2 raw copper.
- Before proposing another trade, I need to re-evaluate what I can craft with my current resources.  <current status>
- I can smelt my 2 raw iron into 2 iron ingots using my 1 coal. This would give me a total of 5 iron ingots, leaving me 1 short of a bucket.  Trading for 1 more iron ingot or 1 more raw iron would be ideal.  Since my opponent likely needs iron for a bucket, trading for their raw iron might be difficult. Offering something they might need for other crafts could be more effective.  They have cherry planks, which suggests they might be working towards something wooden.  Perhaps offering raw copper, which they also have, might entice them to trade for their raw iron.

## üåÄ Turn 3 start!
----------------------------------------

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is to craft a compass.  I need 4 iron ingots and 1 redstone dust. I currently have 2 iron ingots and 1 raw iron. I need 1 more iron ingot.  The opponent has 3 iron ingots. I can offer them raw copper since they just crafted a copper ingot.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **compass**.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is to craft a compass. It seems like "compass" isn't a valid item name. I'll try "iron_ingot" to see what I can learn about crafting it.  I currently have 2 iron ingots and 1 raw iron. I need 2 more iron ingots.  The opponent has 3 iron ingots. I can offer them raw copper since they just crafted a copper ingot.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **iron_ingot**.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I need at least one more iron ingot.  I can offer my raw copper since the opponent has already made a copper ingot and might not need the raw materials as much. I'll ask for two iron ingots in return, hoping they'll agree to a slightly favorable trade for me.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:iron_ingot * 2, ], offer [minecraft:raw_copper * 1, ] together with a text message: I have some raw copper you might find useful. I'm looking for a couple more iron ingots. Would you be willing to trade?


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- Player 1 seems very focused on acquiring iron ingots. They traded for them last turn, and now they're trying to trade for more, even offering raw copper which is less valuable. This suggests their target item likely requires a significant amount of iron. My strategy should be to hoard iron ingots to prevent them from reaching their goal.  Rejecting this trade will hinder their progress.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2 decided to reject the proposal with a text message: I need the iron ingots more than the raw copper right now.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is `minecraft:iron_pickaxe`. I have 2 `minecraft:iron_ingot`, 1 `minecraft:raw_copper`, and 1 `minecraft:raw_iron`.  My opponent, player 2, has 2 `minecraft:cobblestone`, 1 `minecraft:copper_ingot`, 3 `minecraft:iron_ingot`, and 1 `minecraft:raw_copper`.  I need 3 `minecraft:iron_ingot` and 2 sticks for an `iron_pickaxe`. I can smelt my `raw_iron` into an `iron_ingot`. I need more iron ingots or sticks from my opponent. My previous attempts to trade for iron ingots have failed.  Perhaps I should try to craft sticks and trade those for the remaining iron ingot.
- Let's see what I can craft with what I have.  <current status>
- Based on the possible recipes, I can smelt my raw iron into an iron ingot. I can also try to trade my raw copper for an iron ingot.
- I need to review the recipe for the iron pickaxe to make sure I have the correct ingredients.
- I will smelt my raw iron into an iron ingot. Then I will attempt to trade my raw copper and/or newly crafted iron ingot for sticks or another iron ingot.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is `minecraft:bucket`.  I currently have 3 iron ingots, 2 cobblestone, 1 raw copper, and 1 copper ingot. I need more iron to craft a bucket. Player 1 seems to also need iron, as they tried to trade for it twice. They also have 1 raw iron and 1 raw copper. I've tried trading for their iron ingots, but they rejected. I need to find another way to get more iron.
- Let's see what I can craft with what I have.  Maybe there's something I can trade.  <current status>
- Based on the possible recipes, I can't craft anything useful for my target with my current resources. I still need one more iron ingot.  Since direct trading failed, I need to consider other options. Maybe I can offer something else they might need, like cobblestone, in exchange for their raw iron.  If I can get their raw iron, I can smelt it into an ingot.
- I need fuel to smelt raw iron. I don't have any coal or other fuel sources.  I need to factor this into my trading strategy.  Perhaps I can offer a copper ingot and some cobblestone for their raw iron and raw copper. This would give them materials they might need, and consolidate my copper and give me enough iron to make the bucket.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is `minecraft:iron_pickaxe`. I have 2 `minecraft:iron_ingot`, 1 `minecraft:raw_copper`, and 1 `minecraft:raw_iron`.  My opponent, player 2, has 2 `minecraft:cobblestone`, 1 `minecraft:copper_ingot`, 3 `minecraft:iron_ingot`, and 1 `minecraft:raw_copper`.  I need 3 `minecraft:iron_ingot` and 2 sticks for an `iron_pickaxe`.
- I need to confirm the exact recipe for the iron pickaxe.  <current status>
- I can smelt my `raw_iron` into an `iron_ingot`, giving me 3 total.  I still need the 2 sticks. Player 2 doesn't have sticks, but they *do* have cobblestone.  I could try trading for cobblestone and crafting a stone pickaxe to mine wood, then craft sticks. This is a longer route, but might be necessary if I can't trade for enough iron.
- Let's see what I can craft with my current resources.
- Okay, I can definitely smelt the raw iron.  I need to decide if I should risk trading away my resources for a chance at getting the iron directly, or if I should go the longer route of crafting a stone pickaxe.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is `minecraft:bucket`. I currently have 3 iron ingots, 1 raw copper, 1 copper ingot, and 2 cobblestone. I need one more iron ingot to craft the bucket. Player 1 has 1 raw iron and 1 raw copper, and 2 iron ingots. They've rejected my attempts to trade for their iron ingots directly.  They offered me coal and cobblestone for raw iron earlier, suggesting they might need iron for something, possibly a bucket as well.  I need to find a way to get one more iron ingot, either by trading or crafting.
- I'm checking what I can craft to see if I can create something valuable for trading or get closer to my goal.  <current status>
- I can't craft anything directly useful for my target.  I need to focus on getting that last iron ingot.  Since player 1 rejected my previous offers, I need to try a different approach.  They seem to value their iron ingots highly.  Perhaps they need the raw copper for something specific.  I could try offering them my raw copper and something else, like cobblestone, for their raw iron. This would give them more copper to work with and me the iron I need.  I still need to address the fuel issue for smelting the raw iron.
- I'm double-checking the recipe for a bucket to make sure I have the correct requirements.  <current status>
- The bucket recipe confirms I need 3 iron ingots. I have 3, and if I can get player 1's raw iron, I can smelt it into an ingot.  I need to secure fuel for smelting.  Since player 1 offered coal earlier, they might have more. I could try offering them my copper ingot for their raw iron and some coal.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is `minecraft:iron_pickaxe`. I have 2 `minecraft:iron_ingot`, 1 `minecraft:raw_copper`, and 1 `minecraft:raw_iron`.  My opponent, player 2, has 2 `minecraft:cobblestone`, 1 `minecraft:copper_ingot`, 3 `minecraft:iron_ingot`, and 1 `minecraft:raw_copper`.  I need 3 `minecraft:iron_ingot` and 2 sticks for an `iron_pickaxe`.
- I need to confirm the exact recipe for the iron pickaxe and how many sticks I need.  <current status>
- I can smelt my `raw_iron` into an `iron_ingot`, giving me 3 total.  I still need the 2 sticks.  My opponent has no sticks.  I could try trading for enough iron to skip making sticks altogether. If that fails, I'll need a plan to get sticks.  Since I don't have wood, I'll need to consider trading for wood or items that can be used to obtain wood (like a stone pickaxe and cobblestone).
- Let's see what I can craft with my current resources.
- I can smelt the raw iron.  I need to prioritize getting the iron ingots first. If I can't trade for them, I'll focus on getting the materials for sticks.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:

They initially offered coal and cobblestone, suggesting they might need iron, possibly for a bucket as well.  I need to get one more iron ingot, either by trading or by crafting.  Since they rejected my offer of cobblestone for their raw iron, I need to try something else.

- Double-checking the recipe for an iron pickaxe to make sure I have all the components and quantities correct.  <current status>
- I can smelt my `raw_iron` into an `iron_ingot`, giving me 3 total.  I still need 2 sticks.  My opponent has no sticks.  Trading for the missing components is the fastest route. If that fails, I'll need a plan to get sticks, which requires wood or planks.

I still need to address the fuel issue for smelting the raw iron.

They seem to be aiming for something that requires iron, but perhaps not solely iron.  I have a surplus of iron ingots and some copper.  I could try offering a smaller amount of iron this time, or try to get the raw iron in exchange for something they might need for a more complex crafting recipe.  Since they crafted shears, they might be aiming for something involving wool or other shearable blocks.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- The shears confirm they have access to iron, and they likely crafted them for a specific purpose, not just to have them.  I'll try a smaller iron offer and request their raw iron, which could be useful for me and slow them down if they need it.

I don't have any coal or other fuel sources.  The opponent likely needs iron for something, as they've been trying to trade for it.  They also have shears, which suggests they might be aiming for something involving wool or leaves.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- player 1 claims to have completed their objective. This could be a bluff, but their offer of shears for two iron ingots seems genuine, as shears aren't typically high-value crafting components.  I need to consider if shears are more beneficial to my unknown target item than two iron ingots.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **shears**.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- Shears are crafted from two iron ingots.  Since I can craft them myself, trading two iron ingots for shears is a neutral trade in terms of material value. However, if player 1 has truly completed their objective, the trade could be beneficial as it saves me the crafting step and potentially allows me to craft something else more valuable with the saved time.  It's a low-risk trade, even if player 1 is bluffing.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is minecraft:blast_furnace. I have 1 cobblestone, 2 cobblestone slabs, 1 cobblestone wall, 1 copper ingot, 2 raw copper, 1 raw iron, and 1 shears. My opponent has 3 iron ingots and 1 raw copper. I need 5 iron ingots, a furnace, and 3 smooth stone.  My priority is crafting a furnace and smelting my raw iron. I also need to trade for more iron ingots.  Since my opponent has already achieved their goal (shears), they might be more willing to trade now.  I need to be mindful of how much cobblestone I use for fuel so I have enough for smooth stone.  I'll check what I can craft first.

## üåÄ Turn 7 start!
----------------------------------------

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My goal is to acquire more iron ingots. I currently have three, and I might need more to craft my target item.  I also have a cobblestone slab and player 2 has another one.  Perhaps they'd be willing to trade something for it.  I could offer the slab since it doesn't seem strategically important to me right now.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **iron_ingot**.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I'll offer the cobblestone slab and request an iron ingot.  It's a fair trade, and it directly helps me acquire more iron.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:iron_ingot * 1, ], offer [minecraft:cobblestone_slab * 1, ] together with a text message: I'd like to trade my cobblestone slab for one of your iron ingots.  Let me know if you're interested.


### üñ• Server Event: `server__proposal_invalid`
player 1's proposal is INVALID according to the game rule.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I have 3 iron ingots and a cobblestone slab.  They have a variety of items, including raw materials and tools. I could try to trade my cobblestone slab for something useful, or maybe try to get more iron ingots.  Since my last proposal to trade the slab for an iron ingot was rejected, I'll try something else.  Maybe they'd be willing to trade raw iron for the slab.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **iron_ingot**.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I'll offer the cobblestone slab for their raw iron.  It's a fair trade, and it gets me a material I can use to make iron ingots.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:raw_iron * 1, ], offer [minecraft:cobblestone_slab * 1, ] together with a text message: I'd like to trade my cobblestone slab for your raw iron. Let me know if you're interested.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- Let's consider my current hand and the proposed trade. I have one raw iron, which can be smelted into an iron ingot.  Iron ingots are versatile and useful for many crafting recipes. A cobblestone slab, on the other hand, is less useful to me right now.  Player 1 has three iron ingots already, and traded for two more earlier.  They seem to be collecting iron ingots.  Perhaps their target item requires a significant amount of iron.  Trading my raw iron for a cobblestone slab would give them more material to work with, potentially helping them achieve their goal faster. I should hold onto my raw iron.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2 decided to reject the proposal with a text message: I need the raw iron for crafting. Thanks for the offer.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is shears, and I have already crafted it. The opponent, player 2, seems to be collecting various stone and copper items.  I have 3 iron ingots and a cobblestone slab. Since I've achieved my target, my plan is to maintain my current items and not trade unless it benefits me significantly.  <current status>
- I don't need to craft anything, but I should check possible recipes just in case.
- I'll review the possible recipes and consider if any are strategically advantageous.  However, my primary goal is to maintain my current hand and wait for the game to end.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is `minecraft:blast_furnace`.  The opponent just tried to trade a cobblestone slab for my raw iron. They crafted shears last turn, which seemed like their target.  I have `minecraft:cobblestone_slab: 1`, `minecraft:cobblestone_wall: 1`, `minecraft:copper_ingot: 1`, `minecraft:raw_copper: 2`, `minecraft:raw_iron: 1`, and `minecraft:shears: 1`. I need to figure out how to get more iron.
- I need 5 iron ingots, 3 smooth stone, and a furnace to make a blast furnace. I have 1 raw iron, which can be smelted into an iron ingot. I can make smooth stone from cobblestone, but I don't have any. I also need a furnace, which requires 8 cobblestone.  I need to acquire more cobblestone or iron ingots through trading.  Since the opponent offered a cobblestone slab for my raw iron, maybe they have more cobblestone.  I'll try trading for some cobblestone.  <current status>
- I will offer my raw copper for their cobblestone slab. If they accept, I will have 2 cobblestone slabs. I can then try to trade for more cobblestone.

- My target is shears, and I have already crafted it. The opponent, player 2, seems to be collecting various stone and copper items.  I have 3 iron ingots and a cobblestone slab. Since I've achieved my target, my plan is to maintain my current items and not trade unless it benefits me significantly.  <current status>
- I don't need to craft anything, but I should check possible recipes just in case.  Primarily, I'm just waiting for the game to recognize my win.
- I'll review the possible recipes, but I don't anticipate needing to craft anything. My win condition is already met.

Since I've achieved my target, my plan is to maintain my current items and not trade unless it benefits me significantly.  The game should end now that I have my target.  <current status>
- I don't need to craft anything, but I'll check possible recipes just in case there's a beneficial use for my iron.
- I'll review the possible recipes, but I don't anticipate needing to craft anything. My win condition is already met. I'll likely reject any trade offers unless they are exceptionally favorable.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is `minecraft:blast_furnace`. The opponent just tried to trade a cobblestone slab for my raw iron, indicating they might not need cobblestone and might value iron more. They crafted shears earlier, which likely was their target.  I have `minecraft:cobblestone_slab: 1`, `minecraft:cobblestone_wall: 1`, `minecraft:copper_ingot: 1`, `minecraft:raw_copper: 2`, `minecraft:raw_iron: 1`, and `minecraft:shears: 1`. I need 5 iron ingots, 3 smooth stone, and a furnace.
- The recipe confirms I need 5 iron ingots, 3 smooth stone, and a furnace. I can smelt my raw iron into an iron ingot. I can craft smooth stone from cobblestone, but I'm short. The furnace requires 8 cobblestone.  My current priority is getting more iron ingots and cobblestone. Trading for cobblestone might be difficult since the opponent offered me a slab for my raw iron.  Perhaps they are trying to trick me into thinking they don't need it.  <current status>
- I'll try a different approach. I'll offer my shears for their iron ingot. This might be enticing since they traded for iron earlier. If they accept, I'm closer to my iron ingot goal. If they decline, it reinforces the idea they might be accumulating iron for something else, potentially a blast furnace themselves.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target was shears, and I've crafted it. I have 3 iron ingots and a cobblestone slab.  I've won, so my plan is to hold onto these items and not trade unless a trade significantly benefits me (which is unlikely).  The game should end soon.  <current status>
- I won't craft anything, but I'll check possible recipes just for completeness.
- I'll review the possible recipes, but I don't expect to craft anything.  I've already won.

I need 5 iron ingots, 3 smooth stone, and a furnace.
- I need to analyze how to get more iron ingots.  Trading for them directly might be difficult, given the opponent's previous actions.  Smelting my raw iron is a start, but I need 4 more.  The opponent has 3 iron ingots.  <current status>
- I'll offer my shears and raw copper for two of their iron ingots. This is a more significant offer than before, and it might be tempting enough for them to part with some iron. If they accept, I'll be much closer to my goal. If they refuse, it further strengthens the suspicion that they are also aiming for an iron-heavy craft.
