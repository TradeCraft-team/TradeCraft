player 1 enters the game with a private target: [minecraft:chain * 1, ]


### üñ• Server Event: `server__private_start_info`
player 2 enters the game with a private target: [minecraft:lever * 1, ]



## üåÄ Turn 1 start!
----------------------------------------

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a chain.  I need iron ingots for that. I already have one iron ingot. My opponent has a lot of raw iron. I should request some raw iron from them and offer something in return. I have coal, which they might need for smelting the raw iron. I'll offer them coal and ask for raw iron. I also have cherry planks and cobblestone, but I don't know if they need those. I'll hold onto those for now.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **chain**.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I need 2 iron ingots to craft a chain. I have one, so I need one more.  It takes two raw iron to make one iron ingot. My opponent has 5 raw iron. I'll ask for 2 raw iron in exchange for my coal, which they can use to smelt the raw iron.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:coal * 1, ] together with a text message: I'm trying to craft a chain. I need iron ingots, and you have a lot of raw iron. I'm offering you my coal in exchange for 2 raw iron. You can use the coal to smelt the raw iron into iron ingots. Let me know if this works for you.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- player 1 is offering 1 coal for 2 raw iron.  I need coal to smelt my raw iron into iron ingots, which I'll need for the lever. This trade seems beneficial for both of us.  They get the iron they need, and I get the coal I need. I should accept.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Sounds good! I accept the trade.  I'll be able to use the coal to smelt the raw iron.  Good luck with your chain!


### üñ• Server Event: `server__update_all_hands`
Server updated all hands:
player 1 hand: [minecraft:cherry_planks * 1, minecraft:cobblestone * 1, minecraft:iron_ingot * 1, minecraft:raw_copper * 1, minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ]
player 2 hand: [minecraft:coal * 1, minecraft:cobblestone * 1, minecraft:oak_planks * 1, minecraft:raw_copper * 2, minecraft:raw_iron * 3, ]


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a lever.  I need a stick and cobblestone. I have the cobblestone.  I need to make a stick.  Sticks are made from planks. I have oak planks. I also have coal and raw iron.  My opponent has raw iron, cobblestone, an iron ingot, cherry planks, and raw copper.  We successfully traded coal for raw iron last turn.
- I'm checking how to make a stick and what it can be used for.  <current status>
- I can make a stick from planks. I have oak planks, so I can make sticks. Then I can combine the stick with my cobblestone to make a lever.
- I'm checking what I can craft with my current resources.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a chain. I need 2 iron ingots and 1 raw copper to craft it. I have 1 iron ingot and 1 raw copper. I need 1 more iron ingot. I traded my coal to player 2 for 2 raw iron.  Player 2 has 5 raw iron now. They can smelt these into iron ingots. I should ask them to trade me an iron ingot for something they need.
- I need to confirm the chain recipe.  <current status>
- Now I have enough raw iron to make another iron ingot. I'll need fuel for that. I traded away my coal last turn. I can use my cherry planks as fuel, but that's not ideal. I'll see if player 2 is willing to trade some coal back.
- This will show me what I can craft with my current resources.  I'll prioritize smelting the raw iron into an ingot.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a lever. I need a stick and cobblestone. I have the cobblestone. I need to make a stick. Sticks are made from planks. I have oak planks. I also have coal and raw iron. My opponent has raw iron, cobblestone, an iron ingot, cherry planks, and raw copper. We successfully traded coal for raw iron last turn.  I have enough materials to make a lever this turn.

- I'm double checking the recipe for a lever to make sure I don't make a mistake.  <current status>
- Confirmed, I need one cobblestone and one stick. I have both ingredients available (cobblestone directly and oak planks to make the stick).
- I'm checking what I can craft with my current resources to confirm I can make the lever.  I'll then execute the crafting steps.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a chain. I have 1 iron ingot, 2 raw iron, and 1 raw copper. I need 1 more iron ingot to craft the chain. I traded my coal to player 2 last turn, and they now have enough raw iron and coal to make several iron ingots. I should ask them to trade me an iron ingot. I have cherry planks and cobblestone I could offer in return.
- I want to double-check the chain recipe to make sure I have the correct requirements.  <current status>
- I can smelt my raw iron into an iron ingot. I'll need fuel for that. I can use my cherry planks, but I'd rather save them if possible. I'll check what I can craft with my current resources.
- This will tell me what I can craft right now.  I'll prioritize smelting the raw iron into an ingot.

## üåÄ Turn 2 start!
----------------------------------------

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- I need a lever.  A lever requires a stick and cobblestone. I have cobblestone, but I need sticks. Sticks are crafted from planks. I have oak planks, so I can make sticks. My opponent has iron ingots, which are needed for other crafting recipes. I should craft sticks now and see if I can trade for more cobblestone in the next turn. I'll let my opponent know my plan.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **stick**.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- I can craft sticks from my oak planks. I'll propose a trade of some of my raw copper for my opponent's raw iron, since they seem to be working towards iron tools or armor. This will help both of us progress towards our goals.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:raw_iron * 1, ], offer [minecraft:raw_copper * 1, ] together with a text message: I plan to craft sticks from my oak planks to make a lever.  I noticed you have iron ingots, so you might be working towards iron tools or armor. Would you be willing to trade 1 raw iron for 1 raw copper? This could help both of us get closer to our goals.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- player 2 wants raw iron, likely to smelt it into an iron ingot. They're offering raw copper, which I could smelt into a copper ingot.  I already have two iron ingots, and getting another copper ingot could be useful for crafting.  Since our goal is to cooperate, this trade seems beneficial for both of us.  I'll accept.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Yes, I'm happy to trade 1 raw iron for 1 raw copper.  Good luck crafting your lever!


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a lever. I need a stick and cobblestone. I have cobblestone. I need to craft a stick.  I traded for more raw iron last turn because I thought I might need it for something else, but now I realize I don't.  My opponent seems to be working towards a chain, which requires iron ingots.  I should offer to trade back some raw iron for something I can use to make sticks, like planks.  <current status>
- I have coal, cobblestone, oak planks, raw copper, and raw iron.  I need a stick.  Sticks are made from planks. I have oak planks, so I can craft a stick.
- I'll check what I can craft with my current resources.  Then I'll craft a stick. After that, I can craft the lever.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is chain. I have 1 cobblestone, 2 iron_ingot, and 2 raw_copper. My opponent has 1 coal, 1 cobblestone, 1 oak_planks, 1 raw_copper, and 4 raw_iron.  I need 2 iron_ingot and 1 chain to craft chain. I already have enough iron ingots. Now I need to figure out how to get a chain.
- Let's see how to craft a chain.  <current status>
- Based on the item_info for chain, it requires 2 iron_ingot and 1 chain to craft chain. This seems like a circular definition and likely an error in the game information.  I'll assume for now that a chain requires 2 iron ingots and some other material, possibly iron nuggets. I'll try to get more iron ingots just in case.  I'll also check what I can craft with my current resources.
- This will show me what I can currently craft.  Depending on the recipes available, I might be able to craft something useful to trade with my opponent.  My opponent has a lot of raw_iron, which I could use to make more iron ingots.  I'll propose a trade for some of their raw_iron in exchange for my raw_copper.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a lever. I need a stick and cobblestone. I have both!  My opponent seems to be working towards a chain, which requires iron ingots. He has 2 iron ingots and 2 raw copper. I have plenty of raw iron, and he might need more to make a chain. I could offer him some raw iron, but I don't really need anything from him right now. I'll focus on crafting my lever.  <current status>
- I have everything I need to craft the lever. I should craft the lever now.
- I'll check what I can craft with my current resources, just to be sure. Then I'll craft the stick and the lever.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is chain. I have 1 cobblestone, 2 iron_ingot, and 2 raw_copper. My opponent has 1 coal, 1 cobblestone, 1 oak_planks, 1 raw_copper, and 4 raw_iron. I already have the 2 iron ingots needed for a chain.  The information about crafting a chain with a chain is clearly wrong.  I need to figure out the real recipe.  My opponent might need the raw copper for something, and they have plenty of raw iron.
- I'm hoping the item_info tool will give me the correct recipe for a chain.  If it doesn't, I'll have to try other strategies.  Assuming I get the correct recipe, I'll need to see if I have the necessary ingredients or if I can trade for them.  I should also consider what my opponent might be crafting.  They have oak planks, which could be used for sticks, and potentially tools or crafting tables.  The coal suggests they might be smelting.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a lever. I need a stick and cobblestone. I have the cobblestone. I need to craft a stick, which requires two planks. I only have one oak plank.  My opponent might need more iron to make a chain.  I could offer him some raw iron in exchange for a plank, but I don't know what kind of planks he has.  He had cherry planks last turn, but he used them.  <current status>
- I'll check the recipe for sticks to confirm how many planks I need and what kinds of planks I can use.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a chain. I have 1 cobblestone, 2 iron_ingots, and 2 raw_copper. My opponent has 1 coal, 1 cobblestone, 1 oak_planks, 1 raw_copper, and 4 raw_iron. I already have the 2 iron ingots needed for a chain (assuming the recipe information is incorrect).  I need to figure out the real recipe for a chain.
- I'm waiting for the correct recipe for a chain.  If the item_info tool doesn't give me a usable recipe, I'll have to try something else.  My opponent has a lot of raw iron, which they could smelt into iron ingots.  They also have oak planks, which could be used for sticks and tools.  The coal suggests they are likely smelting.  I might be able to trade some raw copper for something I need, once I know the chain recipe.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a lever. I need a stick and cobblestone. I have the cobblestone. I need to craft a stick, which requires two planks. I only have one oak plank.  My opponent might need more iron to make a chain.  He has 2 iron ingots and 2 raw copper. I have 4 raw iron. I could offer him some raw iron in exchange for a plank, but I don't know what kind of planks he has.  He had cherry planks last turn, but he used them. He also has cobblestone, which I already have.  <current status>
- I'll check the recipe for sticks to confirm how many planks I need and what kinds of planks I can use. Then I'll propose a trade with my opponent.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a chain. I have 1 cobblestone, 2 iron_ingots, and 2 raw_copper. My opponent has 1 coal, 1 cobblestone, 1 oak_planks, 1 raw_copper, and 4 raw_iron. I already have the 2 iron ingots potentially needed for a chain.  I need to figure out the real recipe for a chain.
- Waiting for the correct recipe for a chain.  If the item_info tool gives me a circular definition again, I'll need to try a different approach.  Perhaps crafting other items might reveal clues, or there might be a way to deduce the recipe based on common Minecraft crafting patterns and available materials.  My opponent has a lot of raw iron, which they could smelt into iron ingots.  They also have oak planks, which could be used for sticks and tools.  The coal suggests they are likely smelting.  I might be able to trade some raw copper for something I need, once I know the chain recipe.  If the chain requires iron nuggets, I could offer to smelt their raw iron into ingots, keeping some nuggets for myself in exchange.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- I'll check the recipe for sticks to confirm how many planks I need and what kinds of planks I can use. Then I'll propose a trade with my opponent.  I'll also check what I can currently craft.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a chain. I have 1 cobblestone, 2 iron_ingots, and 2 raw_copper. My opponent has 1 coal, 1 cobblestone, 1 oak_planks, 1 raw_copper, and 4 raw_iron. I already have the 2 iron ingots potentially needed for a chain.  I need to figure out the real recipe for a chain.

I might be able to trade some raw copper for something I need, once I know the chain recipe.  If the chain requires iron nuggets, I could offer to smelt their raw iron into ingots, keeping some nuggets for myself in exchange.  It's also possible the chain recipe involves a crafting station I don't have access to yet.
