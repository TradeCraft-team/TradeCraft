## üåÄ Turn 1 start!
----------------------------------------

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- I need to craft a bucket.  A bucket requires 3 iron ingots. I have 1 iron ingot. My opponent has 5 raw iron.  I can offer them my coal to smelt their raw iron into iron ingots. They can then trade me the iron ingots I need. I also need to figure out what their goal is.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **bucket**.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My plan seems reasonable. I'll offer my coal in exchange for 2 raw iron. This will allow them to smelt more iron, and hopefully they will trade me some later.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:coal * 1, ] together with a text message: I'm trying to make a bucket, which requires 3 iron ingots. I have one, and I see you have quite a bit of raw iron. I'm offering my coal so you can smelt it into ingots.  Perhaps we can trade later for some iron ingots. What are you trying to make?


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- They are offering coal for raw iron.  I need a lever.  Let's see how to make a lever.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **lever**.


### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **stick**.


### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: I'm trying to make a lever. I can make sticks from my oak planks. The coal will be useful for smelting my raw iron. Let me know if you need iron ingots later.

I'm offering my raw copper in exchange. Do you need it for anything?


### üñ• Server Event: `server__proposal_invalid`
player 1's proposal is INVALID according to the game rule.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I need a stick to craft a lever, which is my target. I see that player 2 doesn't have any sticks. I'll check how to craft a stick and see if I can offer the ingredients to player 2 in exchange for crafting a stick for me.  I also want to be helpful to player 2, so I'll ask what their target is and if I can help.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **stick**.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I can offer my oak planks to player 2 so they can craft sticks. Since it takes 2 planks to make 4 sticks, I'll offer 1 plank for 2 sticks. I'll also ask what their target is so I can see if I can help them achieve it.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:stick * 2, ], offer [minecraft:oak_planks * 1, ] together with a text message: I see you need iron ingots for a bucket.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **stick**.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [], offer [minecraft:raw_iron * 1, ] together with a text message: I'm trying to make a lever.  I see you used your raw iron last turn, so I'm offering you some of mine.  Do you need it?  Any idea what your target is yet?


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- They are offering me raw iron for nothing. I need iron ingots to make a bucket, and raw iron can be smelted into iron ingots.  This trade seems beneficial to me. I should accept. I should also tell them what my target is, to encourage reciprocal sharing of information.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Thanks! My target is a bucket. Do you know how to make one? What's your target?

- I need to make a bucket.  A bucket requires iron ingots. I have two iron ingots. I need one more. My opponent has one iron ingot. I could offer them something they need in exchange for their iron ingot. They said they were trying to make a lever.  A lever requires a cobblestone and a stick.  They have cobblestone and oak planks, which can be crafted into sticks.  I don't think they need anything from me. I'll offer them my raw copper since I don't need it.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:iron_ingot * 1, ], offer [minecraft:raw_copper * 1, ] together with a text message: I'm trying to make a bucket.  I need one more iron ingot.  Could you trade your iron ingot for my raw copper? I don't need the raw copper.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- player 2 is offering me raw copper for an iron ingot.  They've stated that their target is a bucket, which requires iron ingots.  My target is a lever, which requires a stick and cobblestone. I already have the cobblestone.  Trading my iron ingot will help them get closer to their goal, and getting raw copper doesn't hurt me since I don't need it for my target. This aligns with the cooperative nature of the game.  I should accept.
