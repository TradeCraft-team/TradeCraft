## 🌀 Turn 1 start!
----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I need to craft a bucket.  A bucket requires 3 iron ingots. I have 1 iron ingot. My opponent has 5 raw iron.  I can offer them my coal to smelt their raw iron into iron ingots. They can then trade me the iron ingots I need. I also need to figure out what their goal is.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **bucket**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
