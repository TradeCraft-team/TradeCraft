player 2 enters the game with a private target: [minecraft:torch * 1, ]



## üåÄ Turn 1 start!
----------------------------------------

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft shears, which requires 2 iron ingots. I currently have 1 iron ingot. My opponent has 5 raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots. I can offer them coal to help them smelt the raw iron, and request 1 iron ingot in return.  I also want to be transparent about my goals and encourage cooperation.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **shears**.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- The item info confirms that shears require 2 iron ingots.  My plan seems sound.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:iron_ingot * 1, ], offer [minecraft:coal * 1, ] together with a text message: I'm trying to craft shears, which requires 2 iron ingots. I have one, and noticed you have raw iron. I'm offering my coal to help you smelt it, and requesting one iron ingot in return.  Let me know if you'd like to trade!


### üñ• Server Event: `server__proposal_invalid`
player 1's proposal is INVALID according to the game rule.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I need two iron ingots to make shears. I already have one, so I need one more.  player 2 has raw iron, which they can smelt into iron ingots. I can offer them coal to help with the smelting process.  I should also consider what they might need in return and propose a mutually beneficial trade.  Perhaps they need planks for crafting something? I have cherry planks, which might be useful to them.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **shears**.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I need two iron ingots to make shears. I already have one, so I need one more. player 2 has raw iron, which they can smelt into iron ingots. I can offer them coal to help with the smelting process. I'll offer them one coal in exchange for one iron ingot.  This trade helps both of us get closer to our goals. They might need planks for crafting, but since I don't know their goal, I'll keep my cherry planks for now.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:iron_ingot * 1, ], offer [minecraft:coal * 1, ] together with a text message: I have one iron ingot and need another to craft shears.  You have plenty of raw iron. I'm offering you one coal to smelt your raw iron into an iron ingot, and in return, I'd like one iron ingot. This trade will help both of us get closer to our goals. Let me know what you think!


### üñ• Server Event: `server__proposal_invalid`
player 1's proposal is INVALID according to the game rule.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:iron_ingot * 1, ], offer [minecraft:coal * 1, ] together with a text message: I have coal and need an iron ingot to craft shears. You have a lot of raw iron.  I'm offering my coal to help you smelt your raw iron. Let me know if you'd like to trade.  This will help us both get closer to our goals.


### üñ• Server Event: `server__proposal_invalid`
player 1's proposal is INVALID according to the game rule.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I need to craft shears, which requires iron ingots. I have one iron ingot, but I need two.  player 2 has a lot of raw iron. I can offer them coal to smelt their raw iron, which benefits both of us.  I'll also ask for one raw iron in return, just in case they don't smelt it all.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **shears**.


### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My proposal looks good now.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:raw_iron * 1, ], offer [minecraft:coal * 1, ] together with a text message: I'd like to trade some coal for some raw iron. I can use the coal to help you smelt your raw iron into iron ingots, and I could use the raw iron myself.  This will help both of us get closer to our goals. Let me know what you think!


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a torch.  A torch requires a stick and coal. I have plenty of raw iron, and trading some for coal will help me get closer to my goal. This trade seems beneficial for both of us, as player 1 mentioned they need raw iron.  Accepting the trade aligns with the cooperative nature of the game.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Sounds good! I'm happy to trade.  I need the coal to make a torch, and the iron ingot will be useful to you.


### üñ• Server Event: `server__update_all_hands`
Server updated all hands:
player 1 hand: [minecraft:cherry_planks * 1, minecraft:cobblestone * 1, minecraft:iron_ingot * 1, minecraft:raw_copper * 1, minecraft:raw_iron * 1, ]
player 2 hand: [minecraft:coal * 1, minecraft:cobblestone * 1, minecraft:oak_planks * 1, minecraft:raw_copper * 2, minecraft:raw_iron * 4, ]


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a torch.  I have coal, which is one component. I need a stick.  Sticks are crafted from planks, and I have oak planks.  I can craft a torch this turn.  My opponent traded coal from me, so they likely need it for fuel or torches as well.  <current status>
- I should craft sticks, then craft a torch.
- Confirming available recipes.
- Confirming stick recipe.
- Confirming torch recipe.
- I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is shears, which requires 2 iron ingots. I currently have 1 iron ingot. My opponent has 4 raw iron which can be smelted into 4 iron ingots. I need to get another iron ingot from them. I already traded my coal for one iron ingot.  I have raw iron and raw copper, which I can't use directly for shears. My opponent also has 2 raw copper.
- I need to figure out what my opponent might need. They accepted the coal last turn, suggesting they might need torches or fuel for smelting. They have plenty of raw iron, so they might be aiming for iron tools or armor.  I should propose a trade of my raw iron for one of their raw iron, so they can smelt it all together.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a torch. I have coal and oak planks. I can craft sticks from the planks and then combine a stick and coal to make a torch. My opponent traded for coal, so they likely need it for fuel or torches as well.  <current status>
- I should craft sticks, then craft a torch.  I need to check the exact recipes to make sure I have the correct amounts.
- Confirming stick recipe.
- Confirming torch recipe.
- I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a torch. I have coal and oak planks. I can craft sticks from the planks and then combine a stick and coal to make a torch. My opponent traded for coal, so they likely need it for fuel or torches as well.  I have enough materials to craft a torch this turn.  <current status>
- I should craft sticks, then craft a torch.  I'll check the recipes to confirm the required amounts.
- Confirming stick recipe.
- Confirming torch recipe.
- I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is shears, which requires 2 iron ingots. I currently have 1 iron ingot. My opponent has 4 raw iron which can be smelted into 4 iron ingots. I need to get another iron ingot from them. I already traded my coal for one iron ingot.  I have raw iron and raw copper, which I can't use directly for shears. My opponent also has 2 raw copper.  Since cooperation is key, I should try to help them achieve their goal as well.
- Knowing what can be made with iron ingots will help me understand what my opponent might be trying to craft. They traded away their coal, so they might not be aiming for anything requiring a lot of smelting.  Perhaps they need iron ingots for something like an iron pickaxe, bucket, or other iron tools.  I should ask them what their target is to facilitate better cooperation.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a torch. I have coal and one oak plank. I can craft sticks from planks and then combine a stick and coal to make a torch. My opponent traded for coal, so they likely need it for fuel or torches as well.  I only have one oak plank, so I need to adjust the stick recipe accordingly.  <current status>
- I should craft sticks, then craft a torch.  I'll check the recipes to confirm the required amounts and adjust as needed.
- Confirming stick recipe and adjusting for the amount of planks I have.
- Confirming torch recipe.
- I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a torch. I have coal and one oak plank. I can craft sticks from planks and then combine a stick and coal to make a torch. My opponent traded for coal, so they likely need it for fuel or torches as well.  I only have one oak plank, so I'll craft 2 sticks.  <current status>
- I should craft sticks, then craft a torch.  I'll use the `item_info` tool to double-check the recipes, but I'm pretty sure I have this right.
- Confirming stick recipe.
- Confirming torch recipe.
- I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is shears, which requires 2 iron ingots. I currently have 1 iron ingot. My opponent has 4 raw iron which can be smelted into 4 iron ingots. I need to get another iron ingot from them. I already traded my coal for one iron ingot.  I have raw iron and raw copper, which I can't use directly for shears. My opponent also has 2 raw copper.  Since cooperation is key, I should try to help them achieve their goal as well.  Asking for their target directly might be too forward, so I'll try to infer it based on their resources and actions.
- I think I have a good plan.

I traded for an extra raw copper last turn, which I don't need. I should offer to smelt their raw iron in exchange for one iron ingot. I have enough coal to smelt two raw iron. I also have some extra wood planks and cobblestone. I will offer these extra materials to incentivize the trade.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a torch.  I need coal and sticks. I already have coal. Sticks are crafted from planks, and I have oak planks.  So I can make a torch without needing any more raw materials.  player 1 says they need iron to make shears.  Helping them may help me in the long run.  Trading 2 raw iron for 1 raw copper seems like a fair trade, especially since I don't need the iron.

I can smelt my raw iron to get more iron ingots. To smelt, I need fuel. I don't have any fuel. My opponent has coal, which is a fuel. I can try to trade my raw copper for their coal.
- Confirming the recipe for shears and checking if there are any alternative ways to obtain iron ingots.
- I need to figure out the best way to get the remaining iron ingot I need. Trading for coal to smelt my raw iron seems like the most efficient approach.  <current status>

## üåÄ Turn 5 start!
----------------------------------------

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I need two iron ingots to craft shears. I currently have one iron ingot and three raw iron.  I can smelt the raw iron into iron ingots, but I need fuel for the furnace. My partner has coal, which can be used as fuel. I should request some coal from my partner. In return, I can offer them some raw iron, which they might need for future crafting.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **shears**.


### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:coal * 1, ], offer [minecraft:raw_iron * 1, ] together with a text message: I need coal to smelt iron so I can craft shears. I can offer you some raw iron in return.  Let me know if this trade works for you.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- player 1 is offering 1 raw iron for 1 coal.  They've stated they need the coal to smelt iron to make shears. I need coal to make a torch, my target item.  However, helping them may be beneficial in the long run, as it aligns with the cooperative nature of the game.  I'll check what I can craft with raw iron.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **raw_iron**.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- I can't do anything useful with more raw iron.  Since player 1 needs the coal to progress, and helping them is important for the cooperative win, I will accept the trade, even though it puts my goal at a slight disadvantage.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: I need the coal myself, but I'm happy to help you progress.  Let me know if you need anything else.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is shears, which requires 2 iron ingots. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron.  I need one more iron ingot. I can smelt raw iron into iron ingots. I have coal now, so I can smelt the raw iron. My partner has crafted their target item, so they may be willing to trade for things I need.
- I'll check what I can craft with what I have. Then I'll see if I can make a reasonable trade proposal.  <current status>
- I can smelt my 2 raw iron into 2 iron ingots using the coal. This will give me enough iron ingots to craft the shears.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a torch. I need sticks and coal or charcoal. I have coal. Now I need sticks. Sticks are crafted from planks, and I have oak planks.  My opponent player 1 seems to be trying to craft shears, needing iron ingots for that. They traded for coal to smelt their raw iron.  <current status>
- I can craft sticks from the oak planks I have. Then I can craft a torch using the sticks and coal.
- I'll check what I can craft with my current resources.  Then I'll craft sticks and then the torch.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is shears, which requires 2 iron ingots. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron. I also have coal. I traded for coal last turn. My partner has finished crafting their target and offered to trade.
- I'll check what I can craft with what I have. Then I'll see if I can make a reasonable trade proposal.  <current status>
- I can smelt my 2 raw iron into 2 iron ingots using the coal. This will give me a total of 3 iron ingots. I only need 2 for the shears. I can offer my extra iron ingot to my partner in exchange for something I might need in the future, or just to be helpful since they helped me.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is shears, which requires 2 iron ingots. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron. I also have coal. I traded for coal last turn. My partner has finished crafting their target and offered to trade. I have enough materials to craft the shears.
- I'll check what I can craft with what I have.  <current status>
- I can smelt my 2 raw iron into 2 iron ingots using the coal. This will give me a total of 3 iron ingots. I only need 2 for the shears. I can offer my extra iron ingot to my partner in exchange for something I might need in the future, or just to be helpful since they helped me.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a torch. I need sticks and coal or charcoal. I have 1 coal, 1 oak planks, 2 raw copper, and 3 raw iron.  My opponent player 1 seems to be trying to craft shears, needing iron ingots for that. They traded coal for raw iron. I traded coal to them for raw iron. Now I have no coal.  <current status>
- I need to get coal back or find a way to make charcoal.  Since my opponent wants iron, maybe I can trade some raw iron for coal.  If that doesn't work, I'll need to find a way to make charcoal.  I need wood to make charcoal, but I only have oak planks.  I can't make charcoal directly from planks.  I need logs.
- I'll double-check the recipe for a torch to make sure I haven't missed anything.
- I'll check how to obtain coal, just in case there's a way I'm overlooking.
- I'll check what I can craft with my current resources.  I might be able to craft something useful for trading.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is shears, which requires 2 iron ingots. I have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron. I also have coal, which I can use to smelt the raw iron. I should be able to craft the shears this turn.
- I can smelt the raw iron into iron ingots and then craft the shears.

- I can smelt the raw iron into iron ingots and then craft the shears.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a torch. I need sticks and coal or charcoal. I have oak planks, raw copper, and raw iron.  My opponent player 1 seems to be trying to craft shears, needing iron ingots for that. They traded for my coal in the last turn. Now I have no coal.  <current status>
- I need to get coal back.  My opponent has coal now, so I should try to trade for it again.  I can offer them raw iron since they seem to need it for shears.
- Double-checking the torch recipe to be absolutely sure.
- Checking what I can craft, though I don't think I have the resources for much right now.  My priority is getting coal back.
