## 🌀 Turn 1 start!
----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I need to acquire more iron to craft a chain. My opponent has a lot of raw iron, which I can use. I can offer them coal in return, which they might need for smelting.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **chain**.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I need two iron ingots to make a chain. I have one, so I need one more.  I'll offer coal for raw iron.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:coal * 1, ] together with a text message: I need some raw iron to craft something. I can offer you coal in exchange. Would you be willing to trade 2 raw iron for 1 coal?


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a stone shovel.  I need cobblestone and sticks. I already have cobblestone. Sticks are crafted from planks, and I have oak planks. So I don't need coal right now.  Trading away raw iron might be beneficial later if I need other items, but for now, it's not crucial.  I'll reject the trade.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2 decided to reject the proposal with a text message: I don't need coal right now. Thanks for the offer though.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I need cobblestone and sticks. I have cobblestone, but I need sticks. Sticks are crafted from planks, and I have oak_planks.  My opponent has coal, which I could use later for smelting raw_iron into iron_ingots.
- I can craft sticks from my oak_planks. Then, with the sticks and cobblestone, I can craft the stone_shovel.  <current status>
- I should craft sticks first, then craft the stone_shovel.
- Confirming the stick recipe.
- Confirming the stone_shovel recipe.
- I have enough materials to craft the stone_shovel.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is 1 chain. I have cherry planks, coal, cobblestone, iron ingot, and raw copper. My opponent has cobblestone, oak planks, raw copper, and raw iron.  I need 2 iron ingots and 1 chain to craft a chain. I only have one iron ingot.  My opponent has 5 raw iron which can be smelted into iron ingots. I need to trade for at least one iron ingot or two raw iron.
- I need to confirm the recipe for chain.  I also need to figure out if my opponent needs anything I have. They rejected coal last turn. Maybe they need cherry planks?  I'm willing to trade some cherry planks for raw iron.  <current status>
- I will offer some cherry planks for raw iron. If they accept, I can smelt the raw iron into iron ingots and then craft the chain. If they reject, I will try to trade for iron ingots directly.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I need cobblestone and sticks. I have 1 cobblestone and 1 oak_planks.  I need 2 oak_planks to make sticks. My opponent has coal, which I could use later for smelting raw_iron into iron_ingots, but it's not immediately relevant to my target.  <current status>
- I don't have enough oak_planks to craft sticks. I need to trade with my opponent for more planks, or find another way to get sticks.  Since my opponent has cherry_planks, which is also a type of planks, I can try to trade some of my raw_iron for their cherry_planks.
- I'll offer 2 raw_iron for their cherry_planks. If they accept, I can craft the stone_shovel. If not, I'll need to rethink my strategy.  I'll also check the recipes again to make sure I have the correct amounts.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is 1 chain. I have cherry planks, coal, cobblestone, iron ingot, and raw copper. My opponent has cobblestone, oak planks, raw copper, and raw iron. I need 2 iron ingots to craft a chain. I only have one iron ingot. My opponent has 5 raw iron which can be smelted into iron ingots. I need to trade for at least one iron ingot or two raw iron.  I offered coal last time and they didn't want it.  I'll try offering cherry planks for raw iron this time.
- Confirmed the chain recipe requires 2 iron ingots.  I'll offer half my cherry planks for 2 raw iron. That seems like a fair trade.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I need cobblestone and sticks. I have 1 cobblestone and 1 oak_planks.  I need 2 planks to make sticks. My opponent has coal, cobblestone, and cherry_planks.  <current status>

## 🌀 Turn 2 start!
----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I need cobblestone and sticks to craft a stone_shovel. I have cobblestone, but I need sticks. Sticks are crafted from planks. I have oak planks, which can be used to make sticks.  I'll craft sticks first and then see if I need anything from player 1.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **stick**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I can craft sticks from my oak planks. The recipe requires 2 planks for 4 sticks. I have 1 oak plank, so I can craft 2 sticks.  With 1 cobblestone and 2 sticks, I can craft the stone_shovel. I don't need to trade with player 1.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [], offer [] together with a text message: I have everything I need. No trade needed this turn.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- player 2 is offering nothing and requesting nothing.  This is effectively a null trade.  They say they have everything they need.  I need iron bars to make a chain.  I currently have one iron ingot.  I need at least one more.  Since they have 5 raw iron, it would be beneficial to trade for some.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **iron_bars**.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I need 6 iron ingots to make 16 iron bars.  I only have one iron ingot.  player 2 has 5 raw iron.  I could try to trade for some of their raw iron.  Two raw iron will smelt into one iron ingot.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1 decided to reject the proposal with a text message: I need more iron.  Would you be willing to trade some of your raw iron?


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I have cobblestone and plenty of raw_iron, but I need sticks.  Sticks require planks, and I have oak_planks.  I can craft sticks and then craft the stone_shovel.  I don't need to trade.  <current status>
- I will craft sticks from my oak planks, then craft the stone_shovel using the sticks and cobblestone.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I have cobblestone and oak_planks to make sticks. I can craft the stone_shovel this turn.  <current status>

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a chain. I have iron ingot, but I need more.  My opponent has a lot of raw iron. I need to trade for some. They rejected my previous offer of coal for raw iron, saying they didn't need coal.  I'll try offering my copper ingot for their raw iron.  <current status>
- I need to figure out how much raw iron I need to get from them. Let's check the recipe for a chain.
- Okay, I've seen the recipe.  I need 2 iron ingots to make a chain, and I already have one.  So I need one more iron ingot.  It takes one raw iron to smelt one iron ingot.  Therefore, I need to trade for at least 1 raw iron. I'll offer my copper ingot for 2 raw iron, hoping they'll accept.
- I think I have a good plan.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I have the cobblestone and oak_planks needed to craft it. I can craft sticks from the planks and then the shovel.  <current status>

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I have everything I need to craft a stone_shovel.  I'll craft sticks from the oak planks, then use the sticks and cobblestone to craft the stone_shovel.  <current status>

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a chain. I have one iron ingot and need one more. My opponent has 5 raw iron. I offered coal for raw iron last turn, but they rejected it. This turn, I offered copper for raw iron, but they rejected that too, saying they have everything they need.  This suggests they might not need iron or copper for their target. I need to rethink my strategy.  Perhaps they need planks for something? I have cherry planks, and they have oak planks. Maybe I can trade my cherry planks for their raw iron.  <current status>
- I'll try offering my cherry planks for 2 raw iron.
- I think I have a good plan.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I need to craft a stone_shovel. I have the cobblestone and oak_planks required. I'll craft sticks from the oak_planks and then craft the stone_shovel.  <current status>

## 🌀 Turn 3 start!
----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I need 2 iron ingots to craft a chain. I currently have 1 iron ingot. My opponent has 5 raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots. I can offer them my copper ingot in exchange for some of their raw iron.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **chain**.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I can offer my copper ingot for 2 raw iron.  That should be enough for them to make a copper ingot and still have enough to trade with me.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:copper_ingot * 1, ] together with a text message: I'll give you a copper ingot for 2 raw iron.  That way we both get what we need.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I need cobblestone and sticks to make a stone shovel.  I already have cobblestone.  Sticks are made from planks, and I have oak planks.  Therefore, I don't need copper.  Trading away raw iron would reduce my options in the future.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2 decided to reject the proposal with a text message: I don't need copper right now.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I need cobblestone and sticks. I have cobblestone, but I need to craft sticks.  Sticks require planks, and I have oak_planks.  My opponent has resources that don't seem to help me. I should focus on crafting the stick and then the shovel.
- Let's see what I can craft with what I have.  I should be able to make sticks from my oak planks.  <current status>
- I have enough oak_planks to make sticks, and I have the cobblestone. I can craft the stone_shovel this turn.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a chain. I currently have 1 cherry planks, 1 cobblestone, 1 copper ingot, and 1 iron ingot.  Player 2 has 1 cobblestone, 1 oak planks, 2 raw copper, and 5 raw iron.  My previous trades have been rejected.  I need 2 iron ingots to make a chain.  Player 2 has enough raw iron to make more than 2 iron ingots.  I need to convince them to trade.  Since they rejected my offer of cherry planks for raw iron and didn't propose anything themselves, they likely don't need wood or copper.  Maybe they need cobblestone?
- I'm checking the recipe for a chain again to make sure I'm not missing anything.
- I'm checking how to make iron ingots, just in case I need to suggest a more complex trade.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I need cobblestone and sticks. I have cobblestone, but I need sticks. Sticks require planks, which I have (oak_planks). My opponent has items I don't need right now. I can craft the stone_shovel this turn.
- I should be able to craft sticks from my oak planks and then combine them with cobblestone to make the stone_shovel.

- My target is a chain. I currently have 1 cherry planks, 1 cobblestone, 1 copper ingot, and 1 iron ingot. Player 2 has 1 cobblestone, 1 oak planks, 2 raw copper, and 5 raw iron. My previous trades for raw iron have been rejected. They seem to have everything they need and aren't interested in trading. I need one more iron ingot.  I need to find a way to make them trade.
- Double checking the chain recipe.
- Checking what I can craft with my current items, even though it's unlikely to be useful for my target.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.  Since they don't seem to need anything, I'll offer them something for free in the hopes they reciprocate.

They have rejected my previous trade attempts. They clearly have enough raw iron to make their own chain if that's their target. I need to incentivize them to trade.
- Reviewing the chain recipe.
- Reviewing the iron ingot recipe.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan. I'll offer a very generous trade to try and entice them.

player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:cherry_planks * 1, ], offer [minecraft:oak_planks * 1, minecraft:raw_iron * 1, ] together with a text message: I'd like to trade some raw iron and oak planks for your cherry planks. Let me know if you're interested.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a chain, which requires iron ingots.  I already have some iron nuggets, and raw iron can be smelted into iron ingots.  Oak planks aren't directly useful for my target, but they could be useful for other crafting recipes.  This trade seems beneficial to me.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Sounds good. I'll trade.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I have cobblestone: 1, oak_planks: 1, raw_copper: 2, and raw_iron: 4.  My opponent has cobblestone: 1, copper_ingot: 1, iron_nugget: 9, oak_planks: 1, and raw_iron: 1. I just traded cherry planks for their raw iron.  I need sticks to make the shovel.
- I need to figure out how to make sticks, and then combine them with cobblestone to make the shovel.
- Okay, confirmed - I need sticks and cobblestone for the stone shovel.  Sticks are made from planks. I have oak planks.  <current status>
- I have enough oak planks to make sticks, and I have the cobblestone. I can craft the stone shovel this turn.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a chain. I currently have cobblestone, copper ingot, 9 iron nuggets, oak planks, and 1 raw iron.  Player 2 has cobblestone, oak planks, 2 raw copper, and 4 raw iron. I need 2 more iron ingots to craft a chain.  I just traded cherry planks for oak planks and raw iron. Player 2 accepted a trade for cherry planks, which suggests they might need them for crafting or fuel.  They rejected my offer of copper, so they likely don't need it.  They also stated they have everything they need, which could be a bluff.
- I need to review how to make a chain to confirm the required ingredients and quantities.  <current status>
- Based on the item_info for "chain", I'll need 2 iron ingots and 1 iron nugget. I have enough iron nuggets, but I'm short one iron ingot. I have one raw iron, so I need one more.  Player 2 has 4 raw iron.  Trading for one more raw iron seems like the best path forward.
- I think I have a good plan.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I have cobblestone: 1, oak_planks: 1, raw_copper: 2, and raw_iron: 4.  My opponent has cobblestone: 1, copper_ingot: 1, iron_nugget: 9, oak_planks: 1, and raw_iron: 1. I just traded my cherry planks for their raw iron. I need sticks to make the shovel, and sticks require 2 planks. I only have one oak plank.
- I need two planks to make sticks, and then the sticks and cobblestone to make the stone_shovel. I only have one oak plank.  I need to acquire another plank. My opponent has one oak plank.  Perhaps I can trade for it next turn.  I'll hold off on crafting anything this turn.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:

I need 2 more iron ingots to craft a chain. I just traded cherry planks for oak planks and raw iron, which was a good move. Player 2 accepted a trade for cherry planks, which suggests they might need them for crafting or fuel. They rejected my offer of copper, so they likely don't need it. They also stated they have everything they need, which could be a bluff.  My priority is getting another raw iron.
- Double-checking the chain recipe to be absolutely sure about the ingredients and quantities.  <current status>
- Confirmed: I need 2 iron ingots and 1 iron nugget for a chain. I have plenty of nuggets and one raw iron, so I'm one raw iron short. Player 2 has 4 raw iron. Trading for one more seems the most efficient way to win. Since they rejected copper before, I'll try offering something else this time.
- I think I have a good plan.

- I need two planks to make sticks, and then the sticks and cobblestone to make the stone_shovel. I only have one oak plank.  I need to acquire another plank. My opponent has one oak plank.  I just successfully traded for their raw iron, so they might be hesitant to trade again so soon. I'll try offering them a good deal for their oak plank. If the trade is unsuccessful, I'll have to wait for another opportunity. I won't craft anything this turn.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a chain. I have cobblestone, copper ingot, 9 iron nuggets, oak planks, and 1 raw iron. Player 2 has cobblestone, oak planks, 2 raw copper, and 4 raw iron. I need 2 iron ingots and 1 iron nugget to craft a chain. I'm one raw iron short.  Player 2 might need wood for fuel, but they also have a fair amount of raw iron.  They've rejected copper before.  I need to make a compelling offer.
- Confirmed: 2 iron ingots + 1 iron nugget = 1 chain.  My best bet is still to trade for raw iron.  Since they've rejected copper and I don't want to give up my oak planks for fuel, I'll offer both cobblestone and copper ingot for a single raw iron. This is a generous offer, making it harder for them to refuse.
- I think I have a good plan.

- Confirmed: 2 iron ingots + 1 iron nugget = 1 chain.  My best bet is still to trade for raw iron.  Since they've rejected copper and cobblestone, my options are limited.  I'll try offering the copper ingot again, emphasizing its value. If that fails, I'll have to consider a less optimal trade involving my oak planks, which I need for fuel.

- Confirmed: 2 iron ingots + 1 iron nugget = 1 chain.  My best bet is still to trade for raw iron.  Since they've rejected copper and cobblestone individually, I'll offer BOTH for a single raw iron. This is a very generous offer and might be enough to sway them. If that fails, I'll have to consider trading my oak planks, which I need for fuel, but it's a risk I might have to take.
