player 1 enters the game with a private target: [minecraft:shears * 1, ]


### üñ• Server Event: `server__private_start_info`
player 2 enters the game with a private target: [minecraft:torch * 1, ]



## üåÄ Turn 1 start!
----------------------------------------

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I need to craft shears.  Shears require 2 iron ingots. I have 1 iron ingot. My opponent has 5 raw iron.  I can trade my raw copper for some of their raw iron. Then I can smelt the raw iron into iron ingots.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **shears**.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I need two iron ingots to craft shears. I have one, so I need one more.  My opponent has five raw iron. I can offer them my raw copper for two raw iron.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:raw_copper * 1, ] together with a text message: I need iron to craft shears.  Will you trade two raw iron for my raw copper?


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a torch.  A torch requires coal and a stick.  A stick can be crafted from planks, which I already have.  I need coal.  Trading away raw iron for raw copper doesn't help me get coal.  I have enough raw copper.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2 decided to reject the proposal with a text message: I need coal, not copper.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a torch. I need coal or charcoal and a stick. I have oak planks, so I can craft sticks. My opponent has coal. I should try to trade for it.
- I have plenty of raw iron, which my opponent might need.  They offered raw copper for raw iron last turn, suggesting they might need iron more than copper. I'll offer a more favorable trade this time.  <current status>
- I will offer 3 raw iron for 1 coal. This is a better deal for them than last turn, and it gets me the coal I need. If they refuse, I'll have to rethink my strategy.
- Reviewing how to make a torch to make sure I have the correct recipe.
- If I get the coal, I can craft the torch immediately.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is shears, which requires 2 iron ingots. I only have 1 iron ingot. My opponent has 5 raw iron, which can be smelted into 5 iron ingots. I need to get at least one more iron ingot from them.  I offered them copper last time, but they rejected and said they need coal. I have one coal, which I can trade for raw iron.
- I need to figure out how much raw iron to request for 1 coal.  Smelting 1 raw iron requires 1/8 of a fuel item (like coal). So, 1 coal can smelt 8 raw iron into 8 iron ingots.  Trading 1 coal for 2 raw iron seems like a fair trade, but I might be able to get more. I'll try offering 1 coal for 3 raw iron.  <current status>
- I will propose a trade of 1 coal for 3 raw iron. If they reject, I'll try 1 coal for 2 raw iron.
- If the trade is successful, I will have 1 + 3 = 4 raw iron. I can smelt these into iron ingots using my coal. Then I can craft shears.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a torch. I need coal or charcoal and a stick. I have oak planks, so I can craft sticks. My opponent has coal. I should try to trade for it.  I offered 2 raw iron last turn and they rejected it.  They said they needed iron for shears, which require 2 iron ingots.  <current status>
- I will offer enough raw iron for them to make shears, plus a little extra as incentive.  Since it takes 2 raw iron to make an iron ingot, and they need 2 iron ingots for shears, I'll offer 5 raw iron for 1 coal. This should be a tempting offer.
- Double checking the torch recipe.
- If I get the coal, I can craft the torch immediately. If not, I'll need a plan B.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a torch. I need coal or charcoal and a stick. I have oak planks, so I can craft sticks. My opponent has coal. I should try to trade for it.  I've offered 2 and then 5 raw iron, and they rejected both. They said they needed iron for shears, which require 2 iron ingots.  Maybe they're bluffing, or maybe they really value that coal.  <current status>
- I'll try one last time with an even more generous offer.  I'll offer all my remaining raw iron (5) for their coal.  If they refuse this, I'll switch tactics and try to get their cherry planks to make charcoal.
- Confirming the torch recipe one last time.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is shears, which requires 2 iron ingots. I currently have 1 iron ingot. My opponent has 5 raw iron.  I need to acquire at least 1 more iron ingot. My opponent rejected my previous offer of copper for coal, stating they need coal. I have 1 coal.
- I need to determine a fair trade for my coal.  Smelting 1 raw iron requires 1/8 coal. Therefore, 1 coal can smelt 8 raw iron into 8 iron ingots. Trading 1 coal for 2-3 raw iron seems reasonable. I'll start by offering 1 coal for 3 raw iron. If rejected, I'll offer 1 coal for 2 raw iron.  <current status>
- Propose a trade: 1 coal for 3 raw iron.  If rejected, propose 1 coal for 2 raw iron.
- If the trade is successful (either proposal), I will smelt the acquired raw iron along with my existing raw copper using my coal. Then, I will craft the shears.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a torch. I need coal or charcoal and a stick. I have oak planks, so I can craft sticks. My opponent has coal. I've offered increasing amounts of raw iron for the coal, and they've rejected all offers. They claim they need it for shears.  It's possible they're bluffing, but I can't risk it.  I need to switch tactics and try to get their cherry planks to make charcoal.  <current status>
- I'll offer all my remaining raw iron (5) for their cherry planks. This is a very generous offer, but I need that charcoal.
- One last check of the torch recipe.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is shears, which requires 2 iron ingots. I have 1 iron ingot and 1 raw copper. My opponent has 5 raw iron, which can be smelted into 5 iron ingots. I need to get at least one more iron ingot's worth of raw iron from them.  My opponent rejected my previous offer of copper for coal, stating they need coal. I have 1 coal.
- I need to determine a fair trade for my coal.  Smelting 1 raw iron requires 1/8 coal. Therefore, 1 coal can smelt 8 raw iron into 8 iron ingots. Trading 1 coal for 2-3 raw iron seems reasonable. I'll start by offering 1 coal for 3 raw iron. If rejected, I'll offer 1 coal for 2 raw iron.  <current status>
- If the trade is successful (either proposal), I will smelt the acquired raw iron into iron ingots using my coal. Then, I will craft the shears. I will also smelt my raw copper if I have enough coal left.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a torch. I need coal or charcoal and a stick. I have oak planks, so I can craft sticks. My opponent has coal. I've offered increasing amounts of raw iron for the coal, and they've rejected all offers. They claim they need it for shears.  It's possible they're bluffing, but I can't risk it any longer.  I need to switch tactics and try to get their cherry planks to make charcoal.  I need to be sure about how to make charcoal though.  <current status>
- I'll review how to make charcoal to make sure I can do it with the resources available.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is shears, which requires 2 iron ingots. I have 1 iron ingot and 1 raw copper. My opponent has 5 raw iron, which can be smelted into 5 iron ingots. I need to get at least one more iron ingot's worth of raw iron from them.  My opponent rejected my previous offer of copper for coal, stating they need coal. I have 1 coal.  They might need the coal for smelting their own raw iron.
- I need to determine a fair trade for my coal.  Smelting 1 raw iron requires 1/8 coal. Therefore, 1 coal can smelt 8 raw iron into 8 iron ingots. Trading 1 coal for 2-3 raw iron seems reasonable. I'll start by offering 1 coal for 3 raw iron. If rejected, I'll offer 1 coal for 2 raw iron.  I also need to consider that they might need coal for other purposes.  Perhaps offering a smaller amount of raw iron would be more enticing.  <current status>
- If the trade is successful (either proposal), I will smelt the acquired raw iron into iron ingots using my coal. Then, I will craft the shears. I will also smelt my raw copper if I have enough coal left. If I only get 1 raw iron, I'll still be one iron ingot short. I'll have to try trading again next turn.

## üåÄ Turn 2 start!
----------------------------------------

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- I need coal or charcoal to craft a torch.  My opponent has coal. I should try to trade for it. I have excess raw iron and raw copper that they might want.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **torch**.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- I can offer some raw iron for coal.  Since 1 coal makes 4 torches, I'll offer 2 raw iron for 1 coal.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:coal * 1, ], offer [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ] together with a text message: I need coal to craft a torch. Would you trade 1 coal for 2 raw iron?


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I need iron ingots to craft shears. Two raw iron can be smelted into two iron ingots. This trade seems beneficial to me.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Deal.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a torch. I need coal or charcoal and a stick. I have coal. I need to craft a stick.  A stick requires 2 planks. I have 1 oak plank. I need another plank. My opponent has a cherry plank. I should try to trade for it.
- Confirming the recipe for torch and stick.
- I have enough coal, but only one oak plank.  I need to trade for another plank from my opponent. They have a cherry plank I can use. I'll offer them some raw iron for it.  <current status>
- I think offering 2 raw iron for their cherry plank is a fair trade. They wanted iron last turn.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is shears, which requires 2 iron ingots. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron.  My opponent has 3 raw iron. I need 1 more iron ingot, which means I need another 2 raw iron. I can trade with my opponent to get the raw iron I need.
- I have cherry planks, cobblestone, and raw copper that I could potentially trade. My opponent has oak planks, cobblestone, and raw copper as well.  They just traded for coal, so they might need it for torches or smelting.  I just traded away my coal, so I don't need more raw copper right now.
- Confirming the recipe for shears.  <current status>
- I need to get 2 more raw iron from my opponent. I can offer them my raw copper since I don't need it for my current plan.
- I will propose a trade of my raw copper for their raw iron.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a torch. I have coal. I need a stick. A stick needs 2 planks. I have 1 oak plank. I need 1 more plank. My opponent has a cherry plank. I just traded with them, so they might not want to trade again so soon. I'll try offering them raw iron again, since they wanted it before.
- Confirming the recipe for torch and stick.
- I'll offer them a slightly better deal this time - 3 raw iron for their cherry plank.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is shears, which requires 2 iron ingots. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron. My opponent has 3 raw iron.  I need one more iron ingot, meaning I need 2 more raw iron.
- Confirming the recipe for shears.  I also need to consider what my opponent might be crafting. They traded for coal last turn, which suggests they might be making torches or smelting something. They have oak planks, cobblestone, and raw copper.
- Checking what I can craft with my current resources. This will help me determine what's valuable for trading and what I can afford to give up.  <current status>
- My best bet is to trade for the raw iron I need. I can offer my raw copper since I don't need it for shears.  If they refuse, I could offer my cherry planks, but I'd prefer to keep those if possible.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a torch. I have coal. I need a stick. A stick needs 2 planks. I have 1 oak plank. I need 1 more plank. My opponent has a cherry plank. I've offered them raw iron twice now. Maybe they need something else.  I have cobblestone and raw copper.
- Confirming the recipe for torch and stick.  Also checking what can be made with cobblestone and raw copper, in case I can offer them something more useful.
- I can offer them cobblestone or raw copper, but I don't know if they need those.  I'll try offering a combination of items this time.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is shears, which requires 2 iron ingots. I have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron. My opponent has 3 raw iron. I need 1 more iron ingot, or 2 more raw iron.
- Confirming the recipe for shears and checking what my opponent might be crafting. They traded for coal last turn, suggesting torches or smelting. They have oak planks, cobblestone, and raw copper.
- Trading for the raw iron is my priority. I can offer raw copper since I don't need it for shears. If they refuse, I'll offer cherry planks, although I'd prefer to keep them.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a torch. I have coal. I need a stick. A stick needs 2 planks. I have 1 oak plank. I need 1 more plank. My opponent has a cherry plank. I've offered them raw iron and cobblestone. They still haven't traded.  I'll try offering them raw copper this time.  Maybe they are trying to craft something that needs copper.
- Confirming the recipe for torch and stick.  Also checking what can be made with raw copper, in case they are trying to craft something specific.
- Raw copper can be smelted into copper ingots, which can be used for various things.  I'll offer them a good amount of raw copper for the cherry plank.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is shears (2 iron ingots). I have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron. Opponent has 3 raw iron. I need 2 more raw iron.
- Trade for raw iron is key. Offer raw copper, then cherry planks if refused. Consider their needs if both are declined.  They might need the cobblestone.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is shears (2 iron ingots). I have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron. Opponent has 3 raw iron. I need 2 more raw iron.
- Trade for raw iron is key. Offer raw copper, then cherry planks if refused. Consider their needs if both are declined. They might need cobblestone for tools or a furnace. I should prioritize getting the raw iron even if it means giving up something valuable.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a torch. I have coal. I need a stick. A stick needs 2 planks. I have 1 oak plank. I need 1 more plank. My opponent has a cherry plank. They haven't traded for iron, cobblestone, or copper.  I'll offer them almost everything I can spare.
- Confirming the recipe for torch and stick.
- I'll keep 1 raw copper in case I need it later.

## üåÄ Turn 3 start!
----------------------------------------

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I need two iron ingots to craft shears. I already have one, so I need one more. Player 2 has 3 raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots. I can offer them my raw copper in exchange for some raw iron.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **shears**.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I can offer my raw copper for one raw iron from player 2.  That should be a fair trade, and it gets me closer to my goal.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:raw_iron * 1, ], offer [minecraft:raw_copper * 1, ] together with a text message: I need one more iron ingot to craft shears. Would you trade 1 raw iron for my raw copper?


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a torch, which requires coal and a stick. I already have coal. Sticks can be crafted from planks, and I have oak planks.  I don't need more raw iron or raw copper for my target. Trading raw iron for raw copper won't help me get closer to my goal. I'll reject the offer.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2 decided to reject the proposal with a text message: I don't need more copper.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a torch. I have coal and I need sticks.  Sticks are crafted from planks, and I have oak planks. Player 1 wants iron, but I need my iron. I will craft a torch this turn.  <current status>
- I have enough materials to craft a torch.
- Confirming I can craft sticks and then a torch.
- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is shears, which requires 2 iron ingots. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron.  I need another iron ingot. My opponent has 3 raw iron. I can try to trade my raw copper for their raw iron.  <current status>
- I can smelt my 2 raw iron into 2 iron ingots, then craft shears.
- Check if there are any better ways to get iron ingots.
- Based on the available resources and recipes, smelting raw iron seems like the most efficient way to get iron ingots.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a torch. I have coal, which is one component. I need a stick. I have oak planks, which can be used to craft sticks.  Player 1 seems to want iron, but I need my iron. I will craft a torch this turn.  <current status>
- I have enough materials to craft a torch. I'll check available recipes to be sure.
- I'll confirm the exact recipes for sticks and torches to make sure I have the correct amounts.
- I think I have a good plan.

- I'll confirm the exact recipes for sticks and torches to make sure I have the correct amounts, even though I'm pretty sure I remember them.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is shears, which requires 2 iron ingots. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron. I need one more iron ingot. My opponent has 3 raw iron.  I just tried to trade raw copper for raw iron, but they rejected it. They said they needed coal in the previous turn, but now they have coal. They might need it for torches or smelting.  <current status>
- I can smelt my 2 raw iron into 1 iron ingot. Then I'll need one more.  I can offer my cherry planks for their raw iron. They might need wood for crafting or smelting.
- Confirming the recipe for iron ingots.  Also checking if there are any other uses for cherry planks that might be beneficial.
- I'll try offering cherry planks for raw iron. If that fails, I'll try offering cobblestone.  It's less useful to me, and they might need it.

- I have enough materials to craft a torch. I'll double-check available recipes and the stick/torch recipes to be absolutely certain about the required amounts.
- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a torch. I have the necessary coal and oak planks to craft it. I'll craft sticks from the planks, then combine a stick and coal to make the torch.  Player 1's desire for iron is irrelevant to my plan.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **stick**.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is shears, which requires 2 iron ingots. I have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron. I need one more iron ingot. My opponent has 3 raw iron. I've tried trading raw copper and cherry planks for raw iron, but they rejected both. They previously said they needed coal, but now they have it. They might be crafting torches or smelting.  They also have 2 raw copper.  <current status>
- I can smelt my 2 raw iron into 1 iron ingot. I still need one more. I'll try offering cobblestone for their raw iron. It's less useful to me, and they might need it for building. If that fails, my only option is to hope they propose a trade involving raw iron. I could also try offering my iron ingot for 2 of their raw iron, but that's risky.
- Double-checking the recipe for iron ingots and shears.
- I'll offer cobblestone first. If that's rejected, I'll consider the riskier trade of my iron ingot for their raw iron.

- My target is shears, which requires 2 iron ingots. I have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron. I need one more iron ingot. My opponent has 3 raw iron. I've tried trading raw copper, cherry planks, and cobblestone for raw iron, but they rejected all of them. They have coal, cobblestone, oak planks, raw copper, and raw iron.  They might be trying to craft something that requires a lot of iron, like an anvil, or maybe they're just hoarding resources.  <current status>
- I can smelt my 2 raw iron into 1 iron ingot. I still need one more. My last resort is to offer my existing iron ingot for 2 of their raw iron. It's risky, but if I don't get more iron this turn, I likely won't be able to craft shears before the game ends.
- Confirming the recipe for shears one last time.
- Evaluating my current crafting options.  If the trade fails, I'm out of luck.

- My target is shears, which requires 2 iron ingots. I have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron. I need one more iron ingot. My opponent has 3 raw iron. I've tried trading raw copper, cherry planks, and cobblestone for raw iron, and they rejected all.  I also tried offering my iron ingot for 2 raw iron, but that was rejected too. They have coal, cobblestone, oak planks, raw copper, and raw iron. They might be trying to craft something that requires a lot of iron, like an anvil, or maybe they're just hoarding resources.  It's unlikely they'll trade for anything I have left.  <current status>
- I can smelt my 2 raw iron into 1 iron ingot. I still need one more.  There's not much I can do at this point. I'll try one last time to offer everything I have except the coal and iron for a single raw iron. It's a long shot, but it's all I have left.
- Checking if there's anything else I can craft, but it's unlikely given my limited resources.
