## 🌀 Turn 2 start!
----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I need a stick and coal to craft a torch. I already have coal.  To make a stick, I need planks. I have oak planks, so I can make sticks myself.  I don't need to trade for anything. I'll offer something I don't need, like raw copper, in exchange for something they might want, like cobblestone, just to encourage trading.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **torch**.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I have enough oak planks to make sticks and I already have coal. I can craft a torch myself.  I'll offer some raw copper for cobblestone, just in case I need it later.

player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:cobblestone * 1, ], offer [minecraft:raw_copper * 1, ] together with a text message: I have enough materials to make a torch, but I could use some extra cobblestone. Would you trade some for raw copper?


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I need iron ingots to craft shears.  I already have one iron ingot and two raw iron.  Trading cobblestone for raw copper doesn't directly help me get more iron. Let's check what I can do with raw copper.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **raw_copper**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- Trading for raw copper would allow me to smelt it into a copper ingot.  However, I don't have any fuel, and I need iron for shears.  This trade doesn't seem beneficial for my goal.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2 decided to reject the proposal with a text message: I need iron for my goal.  Thanks for the offer though.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:

- I have enough materials to craft a torch.
- I will check what I can craft from my current hand.  Then I will craft sticks and then a torch.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a torch. I have coal, which is one component.  Torches require sticks and coal. I have oak planks, which can be crafted into sticks. I have enough materials to make a torch this turn.  <current status>
- I will craft sticks from my oak planks, then craft a torch using the sticks and coal.
- This will confirm the exact recipe for sticks and ensure I have the correct amounts.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is shears. I need 2 iron ingots to craft it. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron.  My opponent has 3 raw iron and 1 coal. I need to smelt my raw iron into iron ingots. To do this, I need fuel. I can ask my opponent to trade coal for something I have, like raw copper.  <current status>
- I will ask to trade 1 raw copper for 1 coal. This should be a fair trade as both are used for smelting. If they accept, I can smelt my raw iron into iron ingots and craft the shears.
- I'm checking the recipe for shears again to make sure I have the correct requirements.
- I'm checking how to make iron ingots, to make sure I have enough raw iron and fuel.
- I think I have a good plan.

- I will ask to trade 1 raw copper for 1/2 coal. This should be a fair trade as I only need a small amount of coal to smelt my raw iron. If they accept, I can smelt my raw iron into iron ingots and craft the shears. If they decline, I can offer 1 raw iron for 1/2 coal instead.
- Double checking the recipe for shears to be absolutely certain.

To do this, I need fuel. I can ask my opponent to trade coal for something I have, like raw copper, or even some of my raw iron since they also have some. I could also offer my iron ingot and ask for 2 raw iron and a portion of coal, then I can craft shears immediately.  However, offering my iron ingot might make my intentions too obvious.  It's a risk/reward situation.  <current status>
- I will first ask to trade 1 raw copper for 1/2 coal. This should be a fair trade as I only need a small amount of coal to smelt my raw iron. If they accept, I can smelt my raw iron into iron ingots and craft the shears. If they decline, I will then offer my iron ingot for their 2 raw iron and 1/4 coal. This is a riskier move, but it could lead to a quicker victory.
