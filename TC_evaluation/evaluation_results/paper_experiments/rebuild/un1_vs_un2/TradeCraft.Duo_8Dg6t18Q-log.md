## 🌀 Turn 1 start!
----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I need to figure out how to craft a chain.  I'll use the item_info tool to get the recipe.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **chain**.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I need an iron ingot and 2 iron nuggets to craft a chain. I already have one iron ingot.  I can get more iron ingots from raw iron by smelting it in a furnace with coal as fuel.  My opponent has 5 raw iron. I'll propose a trade for some raw iron.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **iron_nugget**.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I can offer my raw copper since I don't need it for the chain.  I'll request 2 raw iron from my opponent.  That should be a fair trade.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:raw_copper * 1, ] together with a text message: I need some raw iron to craft a chain.  I'll trade you my raw copper for 2 raw iron.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a lever.  A lever requires a cobblestone and a stick. I already have cobblestone.  Sticks are crafted from planks. I have oak planks, so I can make sticks.  This trade gives me more raw copper, which I don't need.  I have plenty of raw iron.  Trading some away won't hurt my ability to craft a lever. It might be beneficial to appear cooperative.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Sounds good. Let's trade.

I should craft the stick, then the lever.  player 1 traded for raw iron, likely to make a chain, which requires 2 iron ingots and 1 raw copper. They have enough iron now, but only 1 raw copper.
