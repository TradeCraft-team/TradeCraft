### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I need to acquire more iron to craft a chain. My opponent has a lot of raw iron, which I can use. I can offer them coal in exchange, as they might need it for smelting the raw iron.  I also need 2 iron ingots.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **chain**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I need two iron ingots to craft a chain.  I have one, so I need one more.  Since my opponent has five raw iron, I'll offer them coal to smelt it and request one iron ingot in return.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:iron_ingot * 1, ], offer [minecraft:coal * 1, ] together with a text message: I have coal, and you have a lot of raw iron.  I'll trade you this coal for an iron ingot.  This will help both of us get closer to our goals.


### 🖥 Server Event: `server__proposal_invalid`

### 🖥 Server Event: `server__proposal_invalid`
player 2's proposal is INVALID according to the game rule.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I need iron ingots to make a chain.  I already have one, but player 1 has raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots. I can offer them coal to smelt the raw iron, and request some of the resulting iron ingots in return.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **chain**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I need two iron ingots to make a chain.  I already have one, but player 1 has raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots. I can offer them coal to smelt the raw iron, and request one of the resulting iron ingots in return.  Since they have 5 raw iron, and smelting each takes one coal, offering all my coal might be too much. I'll offer one coal for now.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **iron_ingot**.

### 🖥 Server Event: `server__proposal_invalid`
player 2's proposal is INVALID according to the game rule.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [], offer [] together with a text message: Formatting issues repeated multiple times


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- player 2 is offering nothing and requesting nothing. This is likely due to a formatting error on their end, as indicated by their message.  Since they aren't actually requesting anything from me, accepting this trade won't hurt me.  It also won't help me directly, but maintaining a positive trading relationship could be beneficial later.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: I accept your trade proposal.


### 🖥 Server Event: `server__update_all_hands`
Server updated all hands:

player 1 hand: [minecraft:cobblestone * 1, minecraft:oak_planks * 1, minecraft:raw_copper * 2, minecraft:raw_iron * 5, ]


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a lever. I need a stick and a cobblestone. I have cobblestone, but I need a stick.  A stick can be crafted from planks, and I have one oak plank.  I should be able to craft the lever this turn.  My opponent doesn't seem to have anything I immediately need.
- Confirming the lever recipe.
- Confirming the stick recipe.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:

- I think I have a good plan.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is 1 chain. I have 1 iron ingot, 1 cobblestone, 1 coal, 1 raw copper, and 1 cherry planks. My opponent has 1 cobblestone, 1 oak planks, 2 raw copper, and 5 raw iron.  I need 2 iron ingots and 1 chain to craft a chain. I traded coal for iron last turn, but the trade failed.
- I need to figure out how to get another iron ingot. I can't craft it directly, and my opponent has raw iron, not iron ingots.  I could try to trade for another iron ingot, or I could try to trade for raw iron and smelt it into an iron ingot. I need to check if I have enough fuel to smelt raw iron.
- I'll see what I can craft with my current resources.  If I can't craft anything useful, I'll focus on trading for the resources I need. I need to consider what my opponent might be crafting. They have a lot of raw iron, so they might be trying to make iron tools or armor.  I need to make sure I get enough iron to make my chain before they use up all the raw iron.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a lever. I need one stick and one cobblestone. I have the cobblestone and an oak plank. I can craft the oak plank into four sticks, then use one stick and the cobblestone to craft the lever.
- Confirming the lever recipe.
- Confirming the stick recipe.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

- Confirming the chain recipe. I need to acquire one more iron ingot. Since my opponent has raw iron, they might be planning to craft iron ingots themselves. I need to act quickly to secure enough iron for myself. Trading for raw iron and smelting it myself seems like the best approach.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

I can't craft a lever yet. I need to get more planks.  My opponent has cherry planks. I should try to trade for a plank.  I previously offered 2 raw iron, which was rejected. I'll try offering more this time.  <current status>

- My target is a chain. I need 2 iron ingots and 1 iron nugget to craft it. I currently have 1 iron ingot.  My opponent has raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots. Trading for iron ingots and raw iron has failed multiple times. My opponent seems unwilling to trade raw iron. I need to drastically rethink my strategy.  Perhaps I should focus on acquiring fuel first, so I can smelt any raw iron I might acquire later.  Or maybe my opponent needs something completely different.  I'll try offering cherry planks again.
- I'm checking what I can craft with my current resources, but it's unlikely to be helpful since I'm focused on acquiring more iron.  I'll offer my cherry planks for a single piece of raw iron.

- I need a cobblestone and a stick. I have cobblestone, but I need a stick. Sticks can be crafted from planks. I have oak planks, so I can make sticks myself.  I'll check if player 2 has any sticks I could trade for. If not, I'll just craft the lever myself. I also have a lot of raw iron, which I could try to trade for other useful items.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **stick**.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a chain, which requires iron ingots. Trading away my only iron ingot for raw iron would be a step backwards, even if I get two raw iron in return. I need to keep my iron ingot to craft the chain.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2 decided to reject the proposal with a text message: I need the iron ingot to craft something.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a lever. I have cobblestone, oak planks, raw copper, and raw iron.  I need to figure out how to craft a lever, or if I need to trade for something. My opponent has cherry planks, cobblestone, a copper ingot, and an iron ingot.  They seem interested in iron, perhaps for a chain.
- Let's see how to make a lever and what its components are.  <current status>
- Okay, assuming the lever recipe is the standard one, I need a stick and cobblestone. I have the cobblestone, but I need a stick. Sticks are crafted from planks, and I have oak planks.  So, I can craft a stick, then craft the lever. My opponent rejecting my trade offers suggests they might need the iron ingot for something specific, and the copper ingot isn't as crucial to them.  I'll focus on crafting my lever.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a chain. I have cherry planks, cobblestone, a copper ingot, and an iron ingot.  My opponent has cobblestone, oak planks, 2 raw copper, and 5 raw iron. I need to figure out how to get another iron ingot or more raw iron to craft the chain. Trading for raw iron might be a good idea since my opponent has a lot.
- I need to review the recipe for a chain and see what my options are.  <current status>
- Based on the item_info for chain, I know I need 2 iron ingots or nuggets. I currently have one iron ingot.  My opponent has plenty of raw iron, which they offered to trade in the last turn. I should try to trade my copper ingot for at least 3 raw iron.  If I can get 3 raw iron, I can smelt it into an iron ingot and then craft the chain.
- I'll propose a trade of my copper ingot for 3 raw iron.

- My target is a chain. I have cherry planks, cobblestone, a copper ingot, and an iron ingot.  My opponent has cobblestone, oak planks, 2 raw copper, and 5 raw iron. I need another iron ingot.  My opponent declined a trade for an iron ingot earlier, but offered raw iron.  Since they have a surplus of raw iron, I should try trading for enough raw iron to make another ingot. I also need to consider that smelting requires fuel.
- I've confirmed the chain recipe requires 2 iron ingots. I have one, so I need one more.  I could smelt raw iron.  I need to make sure I have fuel for smelting.  Cherry planks can be used as fuel.
- I'll propose a trade of my copper ingot for enough raw iron to make an iron ingot, plus a little extra in case I need fuel.

- I need another iron ingot.  I tried to trade my copper ingot for one last turn, but my opponent rejected it. They said they needed the iron ingot, which makes me think their target might also require iron ingots.  They offered me raw iron for my iron ingot, but I rejected that because I need the ingot itself.  I could try offering them something else, but I don't have much that I'm willing to part with.  Maybe I should try to get more raw iron and craft it into an ingot myself.

- I can craft an iron nugget from an iron ingot. So, I actually need a total of 2 iron ingots for the chain itself, and a third to make the nugget.  That means I need two more iron ingots. My opponent has one, and 4 raw iron, enough to make another.  I need to prioritize getting iron.  <current status>

I need another iron ingot and an iron nugget, or two more iron ingots to craft the chain.  My last trade offer was accepted, giving me 1 raw iron in exchange for my cherry planks.  Player 1 accepted my last trade, which suggests they might need wood for crafting sticks or other wooden items.  They also rejected my offer for their iron ingot, suggesting they might need it for their own target.
- I need to review how to craft a chain to confirm the required materials and quantities.  <current status>
- Based on the item_info for chain, I can either craft it with 2 iron ingots and 1 iron nugget or directly with 3 iron ingots.  I'm going to try to trade for enough iron to craft the chain.  Since player 1 rejected my offer for their iron ingot, I'll try offering my copper ingot for 2 raw iron.  If that fails, I'll offer my copper ingot and cobblestone for their iron ingot.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a lever. I have cherry planks, cobblestone, iron ingot, 2 raw copper, and 3 raw iron. My opponent has cherry planks, cobblestone, copper ingot, and an iron ingot.  I have everything I need to make a lever.

I need either 1 iron nugget and 1 more iron ingot, or 2 more iron ingots to craft the chain. Player 1 rejected my previous offers involving iron, suggesting they need it.  They accepted my offer for the cherry planks, indicating a possible need for wood.  I need to prioritize getting more iron.
- Double-checking the chain recipe to ensure I have the correct requirements.  <current status>
- Confirmed: I need either 2 iron ingots and 1 iron nugget or 3 iron ingots.  Since player 1 seems to value their iron, I'll offer a more substantial trade. I'll offer my copper ingot and cobblestone for their iron ingot and 1 raw iron. This gives them a small gain in raw materials while I get closer to my target. If that fails, I'll offer everything I have except the iron ingot for their iron ingot and 2 raw iron.

I need either 1 iron nugget and 1 more iron ingot, or 2 more iron ingots to craft the chain. Player 1 has consistently rejected my offers involving their iron ingot, indicating they likely need it for their own objective.  They accepted my cherry planks, suggesting they might need wood.  I need to secure more iron, but offering everything but my existing iron ingot hasn't worked.
- Reviewing the chain crafting recipe one more time to be absolutely certain.  <current status>
- I need 2 iron ingots and 1 iron nugget, or 3 iron ingots.  Since direct trades for iron haven't worked, I'll try a different approach. I'll offer my copper ingot for their cherry planks. This might seem counterintuitive, but if they need wood, this could entice them.  If successful, I'll then offer the acquired cherry planks and my cobblestone for their iron ingot. This two-step trade might be more appealing to them. If this fails, I'll resort to offering everything except my iron ingot for as much iron as I can get.

I need either 2 more iron ingots, or 1 more iron ingot and 1 iron nugget. Player 1 has consistently rejected my offers for their iron, suggesting they need it.  My attempts to trade for their cherry planks haven't worked either.  I need to re-evaluate my strategy.
- One last check of the chain recipe to make sure I'm not missing anything.  <current status>
- Confirmed: 2 iron ingots + 1 iron nugget or 3 iron ingots. Since player 1 isn't budging on their iron, my best bet is to focus on getting enough raw iron to craft another iron ingot myself.  I'll offer my copper ingot for 2 raw iron. If that fails, I'll offer the copper ingot and cobblestone for 3 raw iron.  If that also fails, I'll hold onto my materials and hope for better trading opportunities in later turns.

I need either 2 more iron ingots, or 1 more iron ingot and 1 iron nugget.  Player 1 consistently refuses to trade their iron, likely needing it themselves.  My previous attempts to trade for raw iron haven't been successful either.
- I'll review the chain recipe again, just in case.  <current status>
- Confirmed: I need either 3 iron ingots or 2 iron ingots and 1 iron nugget.  Since getting iron directly from player 1 seems impossible, my best strategy is to maximize my chances of crafting another iron ingot. I'll offer my copper ingot and cobblestone for as much raw iron as player 1 is willing to give. This gives them more flexibility in what they offer, potentially increasing the chances of a successful trade. If this fails, I'll simply wait for the next turn and hope for a better opportunity.

I need 2 iron_ingots to make a chain. I currently have one, so I need one more.  My opponent has raw iron which they could smelt into an iron ingot, but they haven't done so yet.  I've tried trading for their raw iron and iron ingot, but they've rejected my offers.  They previously traded for a cherry plank to make sticks, suggesting they might need more wood.

- My target is a chain. I have 1 cobblestone, 1 iron_ingot, and 9 iron_nuggets.  Player 1 has 1 cherry_planks, 1 cobblestone, 1 copper_ingot, 2 raw_copper, and 4 raw_iron. I need 2 iron_ingots and 1 iron_nugget to make a chain. I'm one iron_ingot short.  Player 1 has an iron_ingot.  My previous attempts to trade have been unsuccessful.  Offering a large number of iron nuggets didn't work.  Player 1 seems to prioritize the iron ingot.
- Iron ingots are used in a lot of recipes.  Player 1 might be trying to craft shears, a bucket, a shield, an iron sword, an iron axe, an iron pickaxe, an iron hoe, an iron shovel, or any number of other things.  I need to make my offer more enticing.  Since they haven't shown interest in raw materials, my cobblestone and copper_ingot aren't likely to sway them.  My only real bargaining chip is the iron_nuggets.  <current status>
- I'll offer ALL of my iron nuggets for their iron ingot.  This is a risky move, as it depletes my iron nugget reserves, but it's my best shot at getting the chain.  If this fails, I'll have to seriously reconsider my strategy and potentially abandon the chain as my target.

- I need to consider what I can craft *without* trading for the iron_ingot.  The `possible_recipes_from_hand` action will tell me what's feasible.  If I can't make a chain, I need to identify a secondary crafting target.  Disrupting Player 1's plans would be ideal, but I need more information about what they might be crafting.  I'll analyze their hand again.  They have iron_ingot, raw_iron, raw_copper, copper_ingot, cobblestone, and cherry_planks.  This suggests they could be aiming for iron tools, copper tools, or possibly something involving sticks (from planks).

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a lever, which requires a stick and cobblestone. I already have a cobblestone.  I need a stick, which can be crafted from planks. I have cherry planks. So I can craft a lever now. Trading away raw iron for iron nuggets doesn't help me get closer to my goal. I will reject this trade.

I tried to trade for their iron ingot several times, but they rejected. They seem to want raw iron, but the trades they offered weren't good for me. I successfully traded 1 raw iron for their cherry planks last turn. I could try crafting sticks from the cherry planks.
- I've confirmed the stick recipe. I can make a stick from planks. I have cherry planks, so I can craft a stick. Then I can combine the stick with cobblestone to make the lever.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a chain. I have 1 iron ingot, 9 iron nuggets, and 1 cobblestone.  My opponent has cherry planks, cobblestone, a copper ingot, 2 raw copper, and 4 raw iron. I need another iron ingot to make a chain.
- I'll check the recipe for a chain again to be sure.  <current status>
- I confirmed that I need 2 iron ingots and 1 iron nugget to craft a chain. I'm short one iron ingot.  My opponent has raw iron, but they haven't been willing to trade it for anything I've offered so far.  I'll try offering the copper ingot for their iron ingot again.

I need another iron ingot to make a chain.  I've tried trading for it several times, but my opponent hasn't accepted any of my offers.  I need to try a different approach.
- I'll check what I can make with an iron ingot, besides a chain, to see if there's anything else I can offer that might be more appealing to my opponent.  <current status>
- Okay, iron ingots can be used to make a variety of tools, armor, and other items.  My opponent might need an iron ingot for something specific, but I don't know what their target is.  Perhaps offering to craft something *for* them using my iron ingot might be more enticing than just a straight trade.  I could offer to craft shears, which require 2 iron ingots. I only have one, so I'd need to trade for another one.
