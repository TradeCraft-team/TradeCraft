## 🌀 Turn 1 start!
----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I need to acquire more iron to craft chain. My opponent has a lot of raw iron, which I can use. I can offer them coal in exchange, as they might need it for smelting the raw iron.  I also need 2 iron ingots.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **chain**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I need two iron ingots to craft a chain.  I have one, so I need one more.  Since my opponent has five raw iron, I'll offer them coal to smelt it and request one iron ingot in return.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:iron_ingot * 1, ], offer [minecraft:coal * 1, ] together with a text message: I have coal, and you have a lot of raw iron.  I'll trade you this coal for an iron ingot.  This will help both of us get closer to our goals.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [], offer [] together with a text message: Formatting issues repeated multiple times


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- player 2 is offering nothing and requesting nothing. This is likely due to formatting issues on their end, as indicated by their message.  Since they aren't requesting anything from me, accepting this trade won't hurt me.  It also won't help me directly get a stone shovel, but maintaining a positive trading relationship could be beneficial later.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: I accept your trade, even though it doesn't involve any items.  Perhaps you can try reformatting your proposal next turn?


### 🖥 Server Event: `server__update_all_hands`
Server updated all hands:
player 2 hand: [minecraft:cherry_planks * 1, minecraft:coal * 1, minecraft:cobblestone * 1, minecraft:iron_ingot * 1, minecraft:raw_copper * 1, ]
player 1 hand: [minecraft:cobblestone * 1, minecraft:oak_planks * 1, minecraft:raw_copper * 2, minecraft:raw_iron * 5, ]


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I need cobblestone and sticks. I have cobblestone, but I need sticks. Sticks are crafted from planks, and I have oak_planks.  My opponent has cobblestone as well, but trading is unnecessary as I already have it.
- Confirming the recipe for stone_shovel and stick.
- I have enough oak_planks to make sticks and enough cobblestone to make the shovel. I can craft the stone_shovel this turn.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a chain. I need 2 iron ingots and 1 raw copper to craft it. I have 1 iron ingot and 1 raw copper. I need to get 1 more iron ingot. My opponent has 5 raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots. I will try to trade my coal for their raw iron.  <current status>
- I will offer coal for raw iron. Since smelting 1 raw iron requires 1/8 of a coal, I will offer 1 coal for 8 raw iron. However, my opponent only has 5 raw iron. I will offer 1 coal for 5 raw iron.
- I think I have a good plan.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I need cobblestone and sticks. I have 1 cobblestone and 1 oak_planks.  I need 2 oak_planks to make sticks, so I'm short one plank. My opponent has cherry_planks, which can be used to make sticks. I should try to trade for it next turn. This turn, I can't craft the shovel yet.
- Confirming the recipe for stone_shovel and stick.  Also checking if there are alternative ways to get sticks.
- I think I have a good plan.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a chain. I need 2 iron ingots and 1 raw copper to craft it. I have 1 iron ingot and 1 raw copper. I need 1 more iron ingot. My opponent has 5 raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots. I will try to trade my coal for their raw iron.  I previously tried to trade for an iron ingot directly, which failed because they don't have any.  <current status>
- I will offer coal for raw iron. Since smelting 1 raw iron requires 1/8 of a coal, I will offer 1 coal for up to 8 raw iron. My opponent has 5 raw iron. I will offer all of my coal (1) for all of their raw iron (5).
- I think this is a reasonable plan. If the trade is accepted, I can craft the chain. If not, I'll need to rethink my strategy.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I need cobblestone and sticks. I have 1 cobblestone and 1 oak_planks.  I need 2 planks to make sticks, so I'm short one plank. My opponent has cherry_planks, which can be used to make sticks. I should try to trade for it next turn. This turn, I can't craft the shovel yet.
- I think I have a good plan.

My opponent has 5 raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots. I will try to trade my coal for their raw iron.  I previously tried to trade for an iron ingot directly, which failed because they don't have any.  I also tried to trade 1 coal for 5 raw iron, but the trade didn't change anything, suggesting a problem with the proposal format.  <current status>
- I will offer coal for raw iron. Since smelting 1 raw iron requires 1/8 of a coal, I will offer 1 coal for up to 8 raw iron. My opponent has 5 raw iron. I will offer all of my coal (1) for all of their raw iron (5).  This time, I will make sure the proposal is formatted correctly, specifying the quantities as fractions.
- I think this is a reasonable plan. If the trade is accepted, I can craft the chain. If not, I'll need to rethink my strategy.

You should use the `possible_recipes_from_hand` tool to see all available recipes at this stage.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I will again offer coal for raw iron, using the correct format. Since smelting 1 raw iron requires 1/8 of a coal, I will offer 1 coal for up to 8 raw iron. My opponent has 5 raw iron. I will offer all of my coal (1) for all of their raw iron (5).
- I need to be prepared for the trade failing again. If it does, I need to consider what my opponent's goal might be and how I can adjust my strategy.

I will offer all of my coal (1) for all of their raw iron (5).  This is the most logical trade.  If it fails again, I'll need to test the trading system.
- I need to be prepared for the trade failing again. If it does, I need to isolate whether the problem is with the trading system itself or with my opponent's behavior.

## 🌀 Turn 2 start!
----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I need cobblestone and sticks to craft a stone_shovel. I have one cobblestone, but I need sticks. Sticks can be crafted from planks, and I have oak planks.  My opponent has cobblestone as well. I could try to trade some raw iron for their cobblestone.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **stone_shovel**.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I have enough oak planks to make sticks, and I have one cobblestone. I need one more cobblestone.  I'll offer some raw iron for their cobblestone.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a chain, which requires iron ingots and I already have one.  Two more raw iron would allow me to smelt two more iron ingots. This trade seems beneficial to me.  I'll accept.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Sounds good. I can use the extra iron.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a chain. I need 2 iron ingots and 1 raw copper to craft it. I have 1 iron ingot and 1 copper ingot.  I just traded away a cobblestone for 2 raw iron. I need one more iron ingot. My opponent has 3 raw iron and 2 raw copper. I could trade my copper ingot for one of their raw iron.
- I need to confirm the chain recipe.  <current status>
- I have enough raw iron to smelt into an iron ingot. I can then craft the chain.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a chain. I need 2 iron ingots and 1 raw copper to craft it. I have 1 iron ingot, 2 raw iron, and 1 copper ingot. I just traded my cobblestone for the raw iron. I can smelt the raw iron into an iron ingot. Then I can craft the chain using my 2 iron ingots and copper ingot.
- Double checking the recipe for a chain.  <current status>
- I have everything I need to make the chain.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I have 2 cobblestone, 1 oak_planks, 2 raw_copper, and 3 raw_iron.  I need one more cobblestone and one stick.  My opponent has some materials I could potentially use, but trading might not be the most efficient way to get cobblestone.
- I need to review how to make a stone shovel to confirm the required ingredients and quantities.
- Okay, I remember now.  A stone_shovel requires cobblestone and sticks. Sticks are crafted from planks. I have oak_planks, so I can make sticks. I need 2 planks to make 4 sticks, but I only have 1 oak_plank.  I need one more plank or to trade for sticks directly.  I also need one more cobblestone.
- Let's see what I can craft with what I have.  This will help me determine the best course of action.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

- Confirming the recipe for a stone_shovel: 1 cobblestone + 1 stick.
- Confirming the recipe for sticks: 2 planks = 4 sticks.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a chain. I need 2 iron ingots and 1 raw copper to craft it. I have 1 iron ingot, 2 raw iron, and 1 copper *ingot*.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I need 2 iron ingots to craft a chain. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 1 raw iron, plus 9 iron nuggets.  I can smelt the raw iron into an iron ingot, but I still need one more. My opponent has 3 raw iron. I can offer my copper ingot for 2 of their raw iron.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel, which requires cobblestone and sticks.  I have enough cobblestone, but I need sticks, which are crafted from planks. I already have oak planks, so I don't need more wood.  Player 2 is offering a copper ingot for 2 raw iron. I don't need copper ingot.  I could use the raw iron to smelt it into iron ingots, but that's not a priority right now.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **stone_shovel**.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I need sticks, which are made from planks.  Trading away the raw iron won't hurt my ability to make a stone shovel.  Getting a copper ingot doesn't help me, but it doesn't hurt either.  I'll accept the trade.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Sounds good.

- I need to smelt the raw iron into iron ingots.  I can craft the chain with 2 iron ingots. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 3 raw iron, so smelting the raw iron will give me enough.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

- I have enough raw iron to smelt into iron ingots and craft the chain. I don't need to trade this turn.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:

- Just confirming the recipe for the stone_shovel.  I also want to see if cobblestone is used in any other recipes player 2 might need.
- Okay, I've confirmed the recipe and checked other uses for cobblestone. Now I need to decide what to offer player 2 in exchange for a cobblestone.  They seem to be focused on iron, but I don't want to give up too much of my raw_iron. Maybe raw_copper would be a good offer.  <current status>
- I think offering 1 raw_copper for 1 cobblestone is a fair trade.  It helps me get what I need without giving away too much of my limited iron.

- I can trade for oak planks. One oak plank is enough fuel to smelt the raw iron I need. I will offer some iron nuggets in exchange for the oak plank.
