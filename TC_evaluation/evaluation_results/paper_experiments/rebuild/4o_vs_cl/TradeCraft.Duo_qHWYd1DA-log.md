To craft sticks, I need planks. Looking at my opponent's hand, they have cherry_planks which could be used to craft sticks. I could request those planks in a trade. Alternatively, I could request sticks directly if they're willing to craft them.  Looking at what I can offer, I have raw_iron and raw_copper which might be valuable to my opponent. Since they already have 1 iron_ingot, they might want more iron to craft iron tools or other items.

The cherry_planks can be used to craft sticks (2 planks → 4 sticks), and the cobblestone is directly needed for the lever.  I should propose a trade where I request both the cherry_planks and cobblestone from my opponent. In exchange, I can offer some of my raw materials that might be valuable to them.

player 2  checked the item info of craft: **stick**.


### 🧠 `player 2 ` THINKS:
- I need to determine if this trade helps me reach my target item, which is a lever. To craft a lever, I need 1 cobblestone and 1 stick.  Looking at the recipes, I see that: 1. A lever requires 1 cobblestone and 1 stick 2. Sticks can be crafted from 2 planks (which gives 4 sticks)  Currently, I have: - 2 cobblestone slabs - 1 iron ingot - 2 raw copper - 4 raw iron  The trade would give me: - 1 cherry planks - 1 cobblestone  In exchange for: - 2 raw iron  This trade is actually very beneficial for me because: 1. I would get cobblestone, which I need for the lever 2. I would get cherry planks, which I can use to craft sticks 3. I still have plenty of raw iron left (2 remaining)  With the items from this trade, I would have everything I need to craft my target item (lever). I can craft sticks from the cherry planks, and use the cobblestone directly.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2  decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Thank you for the offer! This trade works perfectly for me as I can use both the cobblestone and cherry planks for my crafting needs. I'm happy to trade 2 raw iron for these items.
