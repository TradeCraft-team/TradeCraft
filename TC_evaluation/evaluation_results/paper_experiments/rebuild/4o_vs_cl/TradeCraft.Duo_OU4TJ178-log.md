### 🧠 `player 2 ` THINKS:
- I need to craft a lever, which requires 1 cobblestone and 1 stick. I already have 1 cobblestone, and I have 1 oak_planks which can be used to craft sticks (2 oak planks → 4 sticks).  Looking at my opponent's inventory, they have: - minecraft:cherry_planks: 1 - minecraft:coal: 1 - minecraft:cobblestone: 1 - minecraft:iron_ingot: 1 - minecraft:raw_copper: 1  And I have: - minecraft:cobblestone: 1 - minecraft:oak_planks: 1 - minecraft:raw_copper: 2 - minecraft:raw_iron: 5  I need another oak plank to craft sticks, or I could try to trade for a stick directly. I notice my opponent has coal which could be useful for smelting my raw iron, and they have an iron ingot already.  I could offer some of my raw iron in exchange for their coal (which I might need for smelting) or directly for a stick if they can craft one.

### 🧠 `player 2 ` THINKS:
- I need to craft a lever, which requires 1 cobblestone and 1 stick. I already have the cobblestone, but I need to make a stick. To make sticks, I need 2 oak planks (which gives 4 sticks), but I only have 1 oak plank.  Looking at my opponent's inventory: - minecraft:cherry_planks: 1 - minecraft:coal: 1 - minecraft:cobblestone: 1 - minecraft:iron_ingot: 1 - minecraft:raw_copper: 1  I could propose a trade where I offer some of my raw iron in exchange for their coal (which would be useful for smelting) or for their cherry planks (which I could use to craft sticks).  Since I have plenty of raw iron (5), I can afford to trade some. I'll offer 2 raw iron for their coal and cherry planks. This would help me progress toward my goal of crafting a lever.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2  submit a proposal to Player 1 , request [minecraft:cherry_planks * 1, minecraft:coal * 1, ], offer [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ] together with a text message: I see you have cherry planks and coal that would be very useful for my crafting needs. I'm offering you 2 raw iron which you could use to craft more iron ingots. This trade would benefit both of us - you get more raw materials for iron, and I get components I need for my crafting goals. What do you say?
