### 🧠 `player 2 ` THINKS:
- I need to craft a bucket, which requires iron ingots. Let me check the recipe for a bucket first to understand what I need.
- I see that a bucket requires 3 iron ingots. Currently, I have only 1 iron ingot, but I need 3 to craft a bucket. My opponent has 5 raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots. Let me check the recipe for iron ingot to confirm.

### 🧠 `player 2 ` THINKS:
- Now I have the information I need. To craft a bucket, I need 3 iron ingots. I currently have 1 iron ingot, so I need 2 more.  My opponent has 5 raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots using coal (1 raw iron + 1/8 coal = 1 iron ingot). I have 1 coal, which is enough to smelt 8 raw iron.  For my proposal, I should: 1. Request 2 raw iron from my opponent 2. Offer something valuable in return, perhaps my raw copper since they already have some  Let me make a proposal that benefits both of us:

### 🧠 `player 2 ` THINKS:
- I need to craft a bucket, which requires 3 iron ingots. Currently, I have only 1 iron ingot, so I need 2 more. Looking at my opponent's inventory, they have 5 raw iron which can be smelted into iron ingots. I have coal which can be used for smelting.  To craft a bucket, I need: - 3 iron ingots total - I already have 1 iron ingot - I need 2 more iron ingots - I can get these by trading for raw iron and smelting it with my coal  For my proposal, I should request raw iron from my opponent and offer something valuable in return.
- Perfect, this confirms that raw iron can be smelted into iron ingots using coal. I need 2 raw iron from my opponent, and I can offer my raw copper since they already have 2 raw copper. This would be beneficial for them as they could potentially craft something with 3 raw copper.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2  checked the item info of craft: **iron_ingot**.


### 🧠 `player 2 ` THINKS:
- I'll propose trading my coal (which they can use as fuel to smelt their raw iron) for some of their raw iron. This way: 1. I get the raw iron I need to eventually craft more iron ingots 2. They get fuel which they'll need for their own crafting 3. It's a fair trade that helps both teams progress

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2  submit a proposal to Player 1 , request [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:coal * 1, ] together with a text message: I'm offering coal which you can use as fuel for smelting. In exchange, I'd like 2 raw iron. This is a fair trade since coal can smelt 8 items, and you'll still have 3 raw iron left for your own crafting needs. This trade benefits both of us - you get essential fuel, and I get materials I need.

- First, I need to understand what a bucket requires to craft and check if I have the necessary materials or need to trade for them.

### 🧠 `Player 1 ` THINKS:
- I need to know how to craft sticks, as they are essential for crafting a stone_shovel.
- I have the information needed to craft a stone_shovel. I need 2 sticks and 1 cobblestone. I can craft sticks using planks. I have 1 oak_planks, which can be used to craft sticks. I need to check if I can craft sticks with the oak_planks I have.
- I have the recipe to craft sticks from oak_planks. I can craft 4 sticks from 2 oak_planks. Since I have 1 oak_planks, I can craft 2 sticks, which is exactly what I need for the stone_shovel.
- I need to ensure I have enough cobblestone. I currently have 1 cobblestone, which is sufficient for crafting the stone_shovel.
- I should consider the possibility of trading with the opponent to secure additional resources or to prevent them from obtaining their target item.
- The opponent, player 2 , has 1 cherry_planks, 1 coal, 1 cobblestone, 1 iron_ingot, and 1 raw_copper. They might be targeting an item that requires iron_ingot or cobblestone.
- To prevent player 2  from obtaining their target item, I should avoid trading raw_iron or cobblestone unless it benefits me significantly.
- I have a clear path to crafting the stone_shovel without needing additional trades. I should focus on crafting the sticks and then the stone_shovel.
- I think I have a good plan.

## 🌀 Turn 2 start!
----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `Player 1 ` THINKS:
- I need to craft a stone_shovel. To do this, I need to know the recipe for a stone_shovel and determine what items I need. I should first check the recipe for a stone_shovel to understand what materials are required.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
Player 1  checked the item info of craft: **stone_shovel**.


### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
Player 1  checked the item info of craft: **stick**.


### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
Player 1  submit a proposal to player 2 , request [minecraft:cobblestone * 1, ], offer [minecraft:raw_iron * 1, ] together with a text message: Hi Player 2 , I noticed you have cobblestone, which I need for crafting. I'm offering raw iron in exchange. This trade can help both of us progress towards our goals. Let me know if you're interested!


### 🧠 `player 2 ` THINKS:
- I need to evaluate this trade proposal in the context of my goal, which is to craft 1 bucket. Let me first check what's needed to craft a bucket.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2  checked the item info of craft: **bucket**.


### 🧠 `player 2 ` THINKS:
- I see that to craft a bucket, I need 3 iron ingots. Currently, I have 1 iron ingot in my hand. I need 2 more iron ingots to reach my goal.  Let me check what raw iron is used for and how it relates to iron ingots.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2  checked the item info of craft: **raw_iron**.


### 🧠 `player 2 ` THINKS:
- I see that raw iron can be smelted into iron ingots using fuel. I need 3 iron ingots total to craft a bucket, and I already have 1 iron ingot. If I accept this trade, I'll get 1 raw iron which I can smelt into 1 more iron ingot, bringing me to 2 iron ingots total.  Let me check what cobblestone is used for to see if I might need it for my goal.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2  checked the item info of craft: **cobblestone**.


### 🧠 `player 2 ` THINKS:
- Looking at the information, I can see that cobblestone isn't directly needed for crafting a bucket. The bucket requires 3 iron ingots, and I currently have 1 iron ingot.  If I accept this trade, I'll get 1 raw iron which can be smelted into 1 more iron ingot (using some fuel like my cherry planks). This would bring me to 2 iron ingots total, getting me closer to my goal of 3 iron ingots for a bucket.  The cobblestone I'm giving up doesn't seem to be directly useful for my bucket goal. Player 1  seems to need it for their own crafting goals (possibly making cobblestone slabs or walls based on their current inventory).  This trade is beneficial for me as it brings me closer to my goal of crafting a bucket. I'll still need one more iron ingot after this, but this is progress in the right direction.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2  decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Thanks for the trade! This raw iron will be helpful for my crafting plans. Good luck with your cobblestone crafting!


### 🧠 `player 2 ` THINKS:
- Let me first understand what we have and what we need. Our target is 1 bucket. I need to check how to craft a bucket and see if we have the necessary materials or need to trade for them.

### 🧠 `Player 1 ` THINKS:
- ** My target is to craft a stone shovel. To craft a stone shovel, I need specific items. Currently, I have cobblestone, cobblestone slabs, oak planks, raw copper, and raw iron. I need to determine the recipe for a stone shovel and see if I can craft it with my current items or if I need to trade for additional items.
- ** I need to understand the recipe for crafting a stone shovel. Once I have the recipe, I can assess whether I have the necessary items or if I need to trade for them. Additionally, I should consider what items my opponent might need and how I can use that information to my advantage.
- ** I have gathered information on the stone shovel recipe and the possible recipes I can craft with my current hand. Now, I need to analyze this information to determine the best course of action. If I can craft the stone shovel directly, I will proceed with crafting. If not, I will plan a trade to acquire the necessary items.
- ** I think I have a good plan.

## 🌀 Turn 3 start!

### 🧠 `player 2 ` THINKS:
- I need to understand what items are required to craft a bucket, and then see what we already have and what we need to trade for.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2  checked the item info of craft: **bucket**.


### 🧠 `player 2 ` THINKS:
- I see that a bucket requires 3 iron ingots to craft. Currently, we have 1 iron ingot and 1 raw iron in our hand. We need 2 more iron ingots to reach our target. Let me check how to craft iron ingots from raw iron.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2  checked the item info of craft: **iron_ingot**.


### 🧠 `player 2 ` THINKS:
- To craft a bucket, we need 3 iron ingots. We currently have: - 1 iron ingot - 1 raw iron (which can be smelted into 1 iron ingot with fuel)  So we need 1 more iron ingot to reach our target. Looking at our opponent's inventory, they have 4 raw iron, which would be valuable for us. They also have cobblestone, oak planks, cobblestone slabs, and raw copper.  I should propose a trade that helps us get closer to our bucket goal while offering something valuable to them. Since we have cherry planks and copper ingot, I could offer one of these items in exchange for some raw iron.

I should propose a trade that helps us get closer to our bucket goal while offering something valuable to them. Since we have cherry planks and copper ingot, I could offer one of these items in exchange for some raw iron.  I see that copper ingot has limited crafting uses (only copper blocks and lightning rods), while cherry planks can be used for various building items. Our copper ingot might be more valuable to trade since we're focused on crafting a bucket.  I'll propose trading our copper ingot for 2 raw iron from Player 1 . This would give us enough raw iron to craft the remaining iron ingots we need (with fuel), while offering them a processed resource they might find valuable.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2  submit a proposal to Player 1 , request [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:copper_ingot * 1, ] together with a text message: Hello! I notice you have raw iron, and I'm offering my copper ingot in exchange for 2 raw iron. This copper ingot is already processed and ready to use for crafting copper blocks or lightning rods without needing fuel. This trade would benefit both of us - you get a valuable processed resource, and I can continue working toward my crafting goals. What do you think?


### 🧠 `Player 1 ` THINKS:
- I need to evaluate whether this trade aligns with my winning strategy, which is to craft a stone shovel. I should check the recipe for a stone shovel to see if copper ingots are necessary or if raw iron is more valuable for my crafting needs.

### 🧠 `player 2 ` THINKS:
- My team's target is to craft a bucket. Let me first check what's needed to craft a bucket so I can understand what resources I need.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2  checked the item info of craft: **bucket**.


### 🧠 `player 2 ` THINKS:
- I see that to craft a bucket, I need 3 iron ingots. Currently, I have 1 iron ingot and 1 raw iron. I need to get more iron ingots or raw iron that I can smelt into ingots.  Looking at Player 1 's inventory, they have 4 raw iron. If I could get some of that raw iron, I could smelt it into iron ingots and get closer to my goal of crafting a bucket.  Let me check what I can offer in exchange. I have cherry planks, copper ingot, iron ingot, and raw iron. Let me see what cherry planks can be used for to understand its value.

player 2  checked the item info of craft: **cherry_planks**.

- To craft a bucket, I need 3 iron ingots. Currently, I have 1 iron ingot and 1 raw iron. I need 1 more iron ingot after smelting my raw iron. Player 1  has 4 raw iron, so I should try to get at least 1 more raw iron from them.  Let me check what copper ingot can be used for, as it might be valuable to trade.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2  checked the item info of craft: **copper_ingot**.


### 🧠 `player 2 ` THINKS:
- To craft a bucket, I need 3 iron ingots. Currently, I have 1 iron ingot and 1 raw iron. After smelting my raw iron, I'll have 2 iron ingots, so I need 1 more iron ingot or raw iron to reach my goal.  Player 1  has 4 raw iron, so I should try to get at least 1 more raw iron from them. Looking at what I can offer, I have: - Cherry planks (can be used to craft various wooden items) - Copper ingot (can be used to craft copper blocks and lightning rods)  Since Player 1  has oak planks but might need different types of wood for crafting, my cherry planks could be valuable to them. The copper ingot could also be useful if they're working toward crafting items that require copper.  I'll propose trading my copper ingot for 1 raw iron. This is a fair trade since copper ingot is already processed (smelted) and has specific crafting uses, while raw iron is unprocessed. This trade would help me get closer to my bucket goal while offering Player 1  a valuable resource they don't currently have.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2  submit a proposal to Player 1 , request [minecraft:raw_iron * 1, ], offer [minecraft:copper_ingot * 1, ] together with a text message: Hello! I notice you have several raw iron pieces, and I'm offering my copper ingot in exchange for just one raw iron.

- I see that to craft a bucket, I need 3 iron ingots. Currently, I have 1 iron ingot and 1 raw iron. I need to get more iron to craft a bucket.  Looking at Player 1 's inventory, they have 4 raw iron. If I can get more raw iron from them, I can smelt it into iron ingots. Let me check how to convert raw iron to iron ingot.

### 🧠 `player 2 ` THINKS:
- Now I understand better. To craft a bucket, I need 3 iron ingots. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 1 raw iron. I can smelt the raw iron into another iron ingot using coal (1/8 of coal per raw iron), but I would still need one more iron ingot.  Player 1  has 4 raw iron, so I should try to get at least 1 more raw iron from them. I can offer my cherry planks since they've shown interest in it in previous turns.  Let me make a proposal to trade my cherry planks for some of their raw iron.

### 🧠 `player 2 ` THINKS:
- I need to make a proposal to Player 1  to help us craft a bucket. Looking at the recipe information, a bucket requires 3 iron ingots. Currently, I have 1 iron ingot and 1 raw iron. I need more iron to reach my goal.  Player 1  has 4 raw iron in their inventory. They've shown interest in my cherry planks in previous turns, making offers for it twice. I should try to trade my cherry planks for some of their raw iron.
- I see that raw iron can be smelted into iron ingots using a small amount of coal. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 1 raw iron. If I can get 2 more raw iron from Player 1 , I could potentially craft a bucket (which requires 3 iron ingots).  Player 1  has shown interest in my cherry planks in previous turns, offering both 1 and 2 raw iron for it. Since they've already offered 2 raw iron before, I'll make the same request. This seems fair based on their previous offers.

### 🧠 `player 2 ` THINKS:
- I need to make a proposal to Player 1  to help us craft a bucket. Looking at our current items, I have 1 iron ingot and 1 raw iron, but I need 3 iron ingots total to craft a bucket. Player 1  has 4 raw iron, which I could use to get the additional iron ingots I need.  Player 1  has shown interest in my cherry planks in previous turns, offering both 1 and 2 raw iron for it. I should try to trade my cherry planks for some of their raw iron.
- This confirms I need 3 iron ingots to craft a bucket. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 1 raw iron. If I can get 2 more raw iron from Player 1 , I could potentially craft a bucket after smelting the raw iron into ingots.

I noticed you have cherry planks, which I could use to craft sticks for my stone shovel. I'm offering raw copper in exchange, which might be useful for your crafting goals. Let's help each other progress!


### 🧠 `player 2 ` THINKS:

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`

- I see that to craft a bucket, I need 3 iron ingots. Currently, I have 1 iron ingot and 1 raw iron. I can smelt raw iron into an iron ingot using fuel. Let me check what I can do with raw copper to see if it would be useful for my goal.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2  checked the item info of craft: **bucket**.


### 🧠 `player 2 ` THINKS:
- To craft a bucket, I need 3 iron ingots. Currently, I have: - 1 iron ingot - 1 raw iron (can be smelted into 1 more iron ingot) - 1 cherry planks (which can be used as fuel) - 1 copper ingot (not directly useful for bucket)  So I'm still 1 iron ingot short of my target. The trade would give me: - I give: 1 cherry planks - I get: 1 raw copper  Looking at the recipes, raw copper can be smelted into copper ingots, but copper ingots aren't used for buckets. I already have a copper ingot anyway.  The cherry planks could be useful as fuel to smelt my raw iron into an iron ingot. If I trade away my cherry planks, I'll lose a potential fuel source.  Player 1  wants my cherry planks to craft sticks for a stone shovel. This doesn't help my goal of crafting a bucket.  Since I need to keep my cherry planks as potential fuel to smelt my raw iron, and the raw copper doesn't help me toward my bucket goal, this trade doesn't benefit my strategy.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2  decided to reject the proposal with a text message: Thank you for the offer, but I need to keep my cherry planks as I'm planning to use them as fuel for smelting. The raw copper wouldn't help me with my current crafting goals.


### 🧠 `Player 1 ` THINKS:

player 2  checked the item info of craft: **bucket**.


### 🧠 `player 2 ` THINKS:
- I see that to craft a bucket, I need 3 iron ingots. Currently, I have 1 iron ingot and 1 raw iron. I need to get more iron ingots or raw iron to reach my goal. Looking at Player 1 's inventory, they have 4 raw iron, which would be very useful for me.  Let me check what raw iron can be used for and how to convert it to iron ingots.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2  checked the item info of craft: **raw_iron**.


### 🧠 `player 2 ` THINKS:
- I need to craft a bucket, which requires 3 iron ingots. Currently, I have 1 iron ingot and 1 raw iron. Looking at the recipe, I can smelt raw iron into iron ingots using fuel. I have cherry planks which can be used as fuel.  I see that Player 1  has 4 raw iron, which would be very valuable for me. I need to make a trade proposal that would be appealing to them. Looking at their inventory, they have oak planks, cobblestone slabs, cobblestone wall, and raw copper.  Since they've been trying to get my cherry planks in previous turns, I could offer that. But I need to make sure I get enough raw iron in return to craft my bucket. I'll need at least 2 more raw iron to have enough for a bucket (since I already have 1 iron ingot and 1 raw iron).

I'll propose trading my cherry planks for 2 raw iron. This seems fair since they've been consistently trying to get my cherry planks, offering various items in return. I'll craft a message that emphasizes how this trade can benefit both of us.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2  submit a proposal to Player 1 , request [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:cherry_planks * 1, ] together with a text message: Hello!

This would help me with my crafting goals while giving you the cherry planks you've been seeking. This seems like a win-win trade that could benefit both of us. What do you say?


### 🧠 `Player 1 ` THINKS:
- I need to evaluate whether this trade will help me get closer to crafting my target item, which is a stone_shovel. I should check if cherry_planks are useful for crafting a stone_shovel or if they can be used to craft something that will help me reach my goal.

If I accept this trade, I'll give away 1 iron ingot and receive 2 raw iron. This would leave me with: - 1 iron ingot - 2 raw iron - 1 copper ingot  I would then need to smelt the 2 raw iron into 2 iron ingots, which would give me a total of 3 iron ingots - exactly what I need to craft my bucket.

Looking at the fuel options, I don't currently have any fuel items in my inventory (no coal, wood, etc.). Without fuel, I won't be able to smelt the raw iron into iron ingots.  This means that if I accept this trade, I'll actually be moving further away from my goal. I'd go from having 2/3 of the iron ingots I need to only 1/3, with no guaranteed way to convert the raw iron.  The trade doesn't benefit me in reaching my target of crafting a bucket.

To craft a bucket: {"input": {"iron_ingot": "3"}, "output": {"bucket": "1"}}  Since I need just 1 more iron ingot to reach my target, I should try to trade for either: - 1 iron ingot directly (ideal) - 1 raw iron (which I can smelt into an ingot)  Looking at my inventory, I have a copper ingot that I could offer in exchange.

### 🧠 `Player 1 ` THINKS:

What do you think?


### 🧠 `player 2 ` THINKS:

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`

### 🧠 `player 2 ` THINKS:

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2  checked the item info of craft: **raw_iron**.


### 🧠 `player 2 ` THINKS:
- I see that raw iron can be smelted into iron ingots with some fuel. Since my target is to craft a bucket, which requires 3 iron ingots, and I currently have 2 iron ingots, getting 1 more raw iron would be helpful as I could smelt it into the final iron ingot I need.  Let me check what I can do with the copper ingot that Player 1  wants from me.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2  checked the item info of craft: **copper_ingot**.


### 🧠 `player 2 ` THINKS:
- I see that copper ingots can be used to craft a lightning rod or copper blocks, neither of which are needed for my target item (bucket). The copper ingot doesn't seem to be useful for my goal of crafting a bucket.  On the other hand, the raw iron that Player 1  is offering would be very valuable to me. I currently have 2 iron ingots, and I need 3 to craft a bucket. If I accept this trade, I'll get 1 raw iron which I can smelt into 1 iron ingot (with some fuel), giving me the exact 3 iron ingots I need to craft my target bucket.  This trade is clearly beneficial for my goal. I'm trading away an item I don't need (copper ingot) for an item that directly helps me reach my target (raw iron).

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
