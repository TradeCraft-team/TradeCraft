They identified what they needed, checked recipes, and formulated a trade proposal specifically designed to obtain the missing ingredients from player 1. Although the initial attempts failed, player 2 persevered, demonstrating a strong drive to achieve their goal and prioritize their own success."

While their focus was on obtaining the coal, their behavior was reactive rather than proactive in terms of self-interest. They benefited from the trade but didn't actively pursue it or strategize beyond accepting the offer."
