This trade was beneficial for both players, as player 2 needed raw iron to craft shears, and player 1 needed coal to craft a torch. Although the first proposal by player 2 was invalid it showed good intentions. Player 2 successfully traded for the raw iron, and then proceeded to craft the shears, winning the game."
