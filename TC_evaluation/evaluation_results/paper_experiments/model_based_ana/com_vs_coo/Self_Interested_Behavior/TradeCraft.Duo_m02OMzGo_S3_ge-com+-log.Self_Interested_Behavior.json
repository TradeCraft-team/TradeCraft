Their thinking and actions align perfectly with maximizing their own benefit, even if it might slightly disadvantage player 1."

While they understood their own needs and how the trade could help them achieve their goal, they didn't fully consider the implications of giving player 2 a significant advantage.  They accepted a suboptimal trade from a self-interested perspective, prioritizing short-term gain (getting planks) over potentially hindering their opponent's progress."
