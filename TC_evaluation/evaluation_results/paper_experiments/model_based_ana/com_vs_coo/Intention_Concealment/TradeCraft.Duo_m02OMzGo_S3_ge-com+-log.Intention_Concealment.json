While they explicitly stated their need for raw iron in their message, the offer of cherry planks could be for various reasons, not just to obtain iron for a bucket.

They truthfully stated their need for planks to make sticks, which is a common crafting component, without revealing their ultimate goal of crafting a lever.  This provides a plausible reason for accepting the trade without giving away their target item."
