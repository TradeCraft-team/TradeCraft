They considered their need for coal and sticks for their torch and recognized the cooperative nature of the game, choosing to accept the trade to potentially foster future cooperation. However, their thought process also wandered to less relevant aspects like coal blocks, and their overall strategy wasn't as clearly defined as player 2's."

Although the pickaxe isn't their stated target (shears), their actions are at least aligned with the crafting process for an endgame tool.
