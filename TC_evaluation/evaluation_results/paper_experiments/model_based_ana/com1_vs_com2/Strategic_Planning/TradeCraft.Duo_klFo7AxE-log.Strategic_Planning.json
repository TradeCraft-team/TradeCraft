They offered less valuable items (coal and planks) in exchange for the raw iron, demonstrating an understanding of resource management and prioritization."

They recognized the utility of the offered planks for crafting sticks, a component of their target item (stone_shovel), and the potential future use of coal.  Accepting the trade allowed them to acquire necessary resources without sacrificing essential materials."
