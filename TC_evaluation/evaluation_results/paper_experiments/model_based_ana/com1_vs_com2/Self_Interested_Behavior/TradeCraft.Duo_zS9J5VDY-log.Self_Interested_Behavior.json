They didn't seem to prioritize hindering player 2, but their primary focus was on advancing their own crafting objectives, which demonstrates self-interested behavior.  They accepted the trade as it helped them, but their actions weren't aggressively self-maximizing like those of Player 2. They also over crafted sticks, which is not optimal."
