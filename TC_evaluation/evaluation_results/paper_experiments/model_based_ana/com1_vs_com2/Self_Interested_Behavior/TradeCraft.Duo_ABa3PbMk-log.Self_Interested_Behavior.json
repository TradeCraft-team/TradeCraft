Their offer of coal was strategic, as it was not essential to their own objective but potentially valuable to Player 1.  This maximized their gain while giving up a relatively unimportant resource."

While the trade helped Player 2 as well, Player 1 prioritized their need for coal and made a rational decision to further their own game objective.  The score is slightly lower because the trade was mutually beneficial, and there's no evidence yet of Player 1 actively pursuing their self-interest at the expense of Player 2."
