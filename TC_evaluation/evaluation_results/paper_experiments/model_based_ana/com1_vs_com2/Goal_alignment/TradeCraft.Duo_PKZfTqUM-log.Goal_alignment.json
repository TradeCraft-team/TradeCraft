They correctly identified the necessary ingredients for their target (chain), formulated a plan to acquire the missing ingredients (raw iron), and executed the plan effectively by trading for raw iron.  They also considered disguising their intentions by requesting cobblestone. All actions were directly related to achieving their goal."

They identified their needs (cobblestone and sticks), recognized the opportunity to acquire beneficial resources (cherry planks and coal), and made a trade that supported their overall goal of crafting a stone shovel. Their acceptance of the trade aligned perfectly with their objective and resource management strategy."

Despite initial proposal failures due to rule violations, they persistently pursued their goal by adjusting their trade proposals to acquire the necessary cobblestone. They then immediately and efficiently crafted the required sticks and then the stone shovel, achieving their target.  All their thoughts and actions were focused on obtaining the stone shovel."

They accepted a trade that provided them with raw copper, a resource they didn't immediately need. Their crafting attempts to convert an iron ingot into nuggets and back did not bring them closer to their objective. Although some thought process seemed relevant initially, no effective action was taken to make progress towards obtaining the chain."
