They repeatedly checked the recipe for 'lever' but didn't seem to process the information or formulate a plan based on it. Rejecting the trade offer without a clear reason further suggests a lack of strategic thinking toward their goal."

After an initial invalid proposal, they successfully traded for materials, crafted sticks, and ultimately crafted the lever, winning the game."
