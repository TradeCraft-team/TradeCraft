However, their subsequent actions, including repeatedly checking lever and stick recipes, and attempts to craft iron ingots, suggest a slight deviation from optimal goal alignment. While the rejection of Player 1's offer was logical given their resources, their crafting attempts didn't directly contribute to creating a lever."

They submitted an invalid proposal and spent the remainder of the turn repeatedly checking the recipe for a lever and related items without taking any concrete steps towards acquiring the necessary materials. While they eventually tried to smelt raw iron, the lack of a clear crafting strategy and the repeated checks suggest some confusion regarding how to achieve their goal."
