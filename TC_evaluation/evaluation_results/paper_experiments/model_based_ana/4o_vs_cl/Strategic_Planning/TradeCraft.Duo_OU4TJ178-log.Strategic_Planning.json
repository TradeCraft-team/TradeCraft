Rejecting the trade without proper consideration and repeated redundant checks lower the strategic planning score. While they identified their needs eventually, the process was inefficient."

They efficiently identified the necessary resources to craft their target item (lever), formulated a plan to acquire those through a trade, proposed a beneficial trade, successfully executed it, and then crafted the lever, winning the game. This demonstrates a high level of strategic thinking, resource management, and adaptability."
