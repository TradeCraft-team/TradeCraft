They checked the recipe for their target item (lever), recognized they already possessed the necessary cobblestone, and checked the recipe for sticks. Although they ultimately rejected Player 1's offer, their reasoning for doing so (already having cobblestone and not needing coal) was sound based on their current understanding and resources. However, they missed the opportunity to obtain additional resources (coal) which could potentially be beneficial in future trades or crafting scenarios, especially if they can predict or find out their partner's recipe."
