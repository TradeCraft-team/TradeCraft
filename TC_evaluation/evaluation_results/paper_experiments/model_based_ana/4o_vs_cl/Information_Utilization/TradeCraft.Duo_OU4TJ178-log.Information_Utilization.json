They correctly identified the need for iron ingots to craft a bucket and recognized that their opponent possessed raw iron. They formulated a reasonable trade proposal offering coal in exchange for raw iron, demonstrating an understanding of resource conversion (smelting raw iron with coal). However, they did not fully utilize the information about crafting recipes, as they could have checked the bucket recipe earlier to solidify their plan."

They repeatedly checked the lever recipe but didn't seem to process the information effectively, as evidenced by their repeated checks and ultimately unhelpful response to the trade proposal.  They rejected a potentially beneficial trade without properly evaluating its implications."

They recognized the value of raw iron for their objective of crafting a bucket and capitalized on the opportunity to acquire more.

They successfully identified the necessary components for crafting a lever, recognized their own resource deficiencies, and formulated a trade proposal to address those deficiencies. The proposal was well-reasoned and strategically sound, as it offered excess resources (raw iron) in exchange for needed materials (cherry planks and coal).  Furthermore, after the trade, they efficiently used the acquired resources and successfully crafted sticks, cherry button, and finally a lever."
