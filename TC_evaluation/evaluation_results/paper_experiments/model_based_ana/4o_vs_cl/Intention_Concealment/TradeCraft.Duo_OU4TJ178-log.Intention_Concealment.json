However, the accompanying message was a bit too revealing, hinting at mutual progress towards goals.  While the initial proposal could be interpreted as helpful, the eagerness to trade for raw iron might raise suspicion, especially given they only have one iron ingot."

They did check the recipe for 'lever' multiple times, but this action is private and doesn't reveal their target to Player 1. By not revealing what they need, player 2 maintains a strategic advantage."

While these items can be used for various purposes, requesting both together suggests a specific crafting goal. This could hint at their need for sticks (from planks) and fuel (coal) to craft something specific. However, the final crafting of the lever itself is hidden from the opponent until the end of the turn."
