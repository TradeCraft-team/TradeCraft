While the trade was highly advantageous for Player 2 in acquiring coal necessary for their target item (torch), the acceptance of the trade also provided Player 1 with the raw iron they needed for their own target (shears). This mutual benefit dilutes the pure self-interest, resulting in a lower score than Player 1."
