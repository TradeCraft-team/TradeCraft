Recognizing the need for more iron ingots to craft shears, they then smelted raw iron using cherry planks as fuel. This turn demonstrates excellent resource management and adaptability by utilizing available materials and making strategic trades to obtain necessary items for crafting the target item, shears."

Player 2 recognized the value of the trade, as they had ample raw iron and needed coal, which they didn't possess initially. This demonstrates adaptability by securing a key resource through a trade."
