Repeatedly checking lever recipe information indicates a lack of focus on the trade interaction.

This shows a significant improvement in cooperative behavior compared to the first turn. Explaining the rationale behind the trade in the message further reinforces the intent to cooperate and establish a beneficial exchange for both players.  Although there were some missteps with invalid proposals earlier, the final proposal and its acceptance contribute to a positive cooperation score."
