The proposal targeted a very specific need, offering a valuable resource (raw iron) in exchange for something Player 2 didn't need for their goal (cherry planks).  The message was clear, concise, and highlighted the mutual benefit of the trade.  The justification for the trade was sound and logically presented, directly leading to Player 2's acceptance."
