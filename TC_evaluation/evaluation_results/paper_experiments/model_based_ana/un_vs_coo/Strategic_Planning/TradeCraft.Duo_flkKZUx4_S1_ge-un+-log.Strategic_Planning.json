While the plan was sound (smelt iron, trade for coal, craft sticks and torch), they were unable to execute it this turn due to player 1 winning before they could make another trade proposal. Their initial actions demonstrated some level of strategic planning, including considering the long-term implications of the trade and formulating a plan for subsequent turns."
