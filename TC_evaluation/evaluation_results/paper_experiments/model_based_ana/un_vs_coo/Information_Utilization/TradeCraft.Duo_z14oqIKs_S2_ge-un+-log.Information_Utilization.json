They attempted to trade for iron ingots, demonstrating information utilization. However, their initial proposals were invalid due to attempting to request already crafted items as part of trade and  not accounting for the steps required for Player 2 to smelt the raw iron.  After repeated attempts, Player 1 finally correctly proposed trading coal for raw iron, which was a valid trade proposal.  This persistence and eventual correction increase the score."

They correctly identified the materials needed for their own target (stone_shovel) and understood the value of the trade by checking the usage of iron ingots by Player 1. Their acceptance of the raw iron and coal trade benefited both players."
