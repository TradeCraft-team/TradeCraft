They recognized the need for coal and attempted to obtain it indirectly by trading for copper, hoping to establish goodwill for a future trade. However, they failed to secure the coal and did not craft any components for the torch, such as sticks.  While there was a plan, it wasn't effective, though trading copper demonstrated social awareness."
