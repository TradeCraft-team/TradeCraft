They repeatedly submitted invalid proposals based on the same flawed logic (offering coal for crafted iron ingots when Player 2 had no way to craft them).  While they eventually corrected their offer to request raw iron instead, this adaptation was slow and came after multiple failed attempts. They also struggled with crafting, submitting multiple invalid recipes."

They correctly assessed Player 1's likely intentions and made a logical deduction about their target item. However, they didn't propose any trades of their own, which limits their adaptability score."
