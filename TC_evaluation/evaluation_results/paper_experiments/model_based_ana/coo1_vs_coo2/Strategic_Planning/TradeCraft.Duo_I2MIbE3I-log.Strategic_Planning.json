However, the initial proposals were invalid, indicating a lack of understanding of the game rules. The final proposal was more strategic, offering coal for raw iron, which could benefit both players.  While the overall plan shows some strategic elements, the initial missteps lower the score."

Recognizing the potential benefit of the trade is a positive sign of strategic thinking. However, there is no evidence of more complex long-term planning yet."
