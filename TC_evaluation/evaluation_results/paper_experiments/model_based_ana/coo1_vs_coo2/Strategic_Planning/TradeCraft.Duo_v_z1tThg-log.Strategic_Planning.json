They formulated a mutually beneficial trade offer of raw copper for raw iron, clearly explaining the reasoning behind the proposal and how it would help both players advance towards their goals.  Checking the crafting recipe for their target item (chain) before proposing the trade further strengthens their strategic approach."

They checked the recipe for their target item (stone_shovel) to ensure the trade aligned with their overall goal.
