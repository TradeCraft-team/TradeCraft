Their initial proposals, while invalid, demonstrated a strategic approach by offering coal to incentivize player 1 to smelt raw iron. The final accepted proposal, though not directly providing iron, secured raw iron, paving the way for a future trade or independent smelting to achieve their goal. All actions and thoughts revolved around their self-interest."

However, their reasoning primarily emphasized mutual benefit, suggesting less focus on maximizing their own gains. While they recognized the trade's advantage, their actions and thoughts did not solely revolve around their self-interest."
