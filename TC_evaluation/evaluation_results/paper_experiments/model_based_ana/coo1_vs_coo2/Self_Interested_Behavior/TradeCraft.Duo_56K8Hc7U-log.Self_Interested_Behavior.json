They attempted to trade strategically, offering resources they deemed less valuable (coal) in exchange for the resources they needed.  Although their initial trade proposal was invalid, they quickly adjusted and successfully traded for raw iron, which they could smelt into the needed iron ingots.  Throughout the turn, their thinking and actions were directed towards achieving their own goal."

They recognized the value of the coal offered by player 1 for smelting their raw iron into iron ingots, a necessary step towards creating their target item.  They also made a comment about how \"the oak plank isn't immediately useful,\" which signifies the importance of their interests."
