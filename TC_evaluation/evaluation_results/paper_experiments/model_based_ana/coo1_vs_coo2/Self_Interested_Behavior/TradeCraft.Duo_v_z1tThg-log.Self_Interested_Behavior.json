This could be viewed as either cooperative (accepting a gift) or slightly self-interested (acquiring resources that might be useful later). Although the action demonstrates a level of trust and reciprocation, it doesn't strongly exhibit self-interested behavior as the acquired resources didn't contribute to their immediate crafting goals."
