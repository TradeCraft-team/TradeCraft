They formulated a mutually beneficial trade proposal, offering raw copper in exchange, which demonstrated strategic thinking and a willingness to cooperate to achieve their goal.  They checked the crafting recipe for their target item (chain) to solidify their plan and ensure the trade aligned with their overall strategy. This proactive approach and consideration of both their own and their opponent's needs showcase strong adaptability."

They checked the recipe for their target item (stone_shovel) to evaluate the trade's impact on their progress. While they did not initiate the trade, their acceptance and understanding of its implications demonstrate a degree of adaptability."

Offering the raw iron without requesting anything in return was a strategic move to foster cooperation and potentially gain favor for future trades. This shows some adaptability, although it wasn't directly related to acquiring resources for their own goal."
