They clearly explained their reasoning and offered a valuable resource (coal) to help Player 1 smelt their raw iron in exchange for an iron ingot to help themselves craft shears. Although their initial proposals were invalid, they persisted in finding a mutually beneficial trade, ultimately offering coal for raw iron, which Player 1 accepted. This allowed Player 1 to obtain coal needed for torches and allowed Player 2 to obtain the raw iron needed to craft shears."
