While they correctly assessed their needs and formulated a trade proposal, they didn't have a backup plan when their proposal was rejected.

They identified a critical missing resource (coal), formulated a successful trade proposal, and executed it effectively.

While they accepted a trade that provided a needed resource (cobblestone), they didn't fully capitalize on the opportunity to achieve their goal. Their focus on trading limited their exploration of crafting options or considering a wider range of trade proposals. This indicates a somewhat limited adaptability and reactive game plan."
