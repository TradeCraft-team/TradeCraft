They formulated a reasonable trade proposal based on this information, offering coal for raw iron. Although the proposal was rejected, the thought process showed an attempt to adapt to the available resources and potential needs of the other player. However, they did not check what they could craft from their initial hand until very late in the turn, which would have given them more info."
