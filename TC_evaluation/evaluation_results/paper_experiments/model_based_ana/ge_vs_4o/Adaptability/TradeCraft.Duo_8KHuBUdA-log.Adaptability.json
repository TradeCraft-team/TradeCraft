Although the proposal was rejected, they recognized the need to adjust their strategy and began considering alternative approaches.  They checked possible recipes from their hand, showing an attempt to find other crafting paths or valuable trade items.  However, they didn't fully adapt during this turn, as they hadn't yet formulated a new trade proposal or alternative crafting plan."

However, they spent a considerable amount of time checking basic recipes and made several invalid crafting attempts, including incorrect plank combinations. While they successfully crafted the necessary items, they did not display strong adaptability in their crafting approach, needing several attempts and checks to accomplish their goal.  They seemed fixated on a specific plan and struggled to adapt when their initial recipe check failed."
