Although the trade was rejected, the attempt to engage in a mutually beneficial exchange is a positive sign. The offered trade was reasonable, proposing coal for raw iron, which could have helped both players progress towards their goals.  However, the initial lack of information-seeking about the crafting recipe before proposing the trade slightly lowers the score."
