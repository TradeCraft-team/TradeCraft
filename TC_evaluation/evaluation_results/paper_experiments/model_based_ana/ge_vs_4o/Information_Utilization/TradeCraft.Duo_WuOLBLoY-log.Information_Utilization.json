They then made a reasonable trade proposal to player 1, offering useful items (cherry planks, coal) in exchange for raw iron.  However, after the trade, their crafting attempts were inefficient.  Although they correctly identified the need to craft an iron ingot using iron nuggets, and eventually did craft a chain after converting nuggets into an ingot, this was indirect and wasted a crafting step by undoing a recipe that they had completed at an earlier step."

Their acceptance of the trade was beneficial.  Furthermore, they efficiently crafted sticks from planks and immediately used those sticks with cobblestone to create their target item, a lever."
