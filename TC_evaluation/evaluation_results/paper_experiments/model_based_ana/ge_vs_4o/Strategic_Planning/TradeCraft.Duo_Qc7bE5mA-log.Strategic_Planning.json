However, the initial proposal was not entirely effective, as it didn't account for the opponent's potential needs. The subsequent thinking shows more in-depth strategic planning, considering the opponent's hand and potential crafting goals, and formulating a revised trading strategy."

This demonstrates effective strategic planning and consideration of their long-term goals. Crafting the stone shovel successfully shows good execution of the plan."
