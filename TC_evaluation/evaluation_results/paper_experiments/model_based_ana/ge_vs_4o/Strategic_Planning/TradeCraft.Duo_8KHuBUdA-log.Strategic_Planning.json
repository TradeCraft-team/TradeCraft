They correctly assessed that their opponent had an abundance of raw iron. However, their initial trade offer was rejected.  They spent the rest of the turn checking possible recipes, which is helpful but doesn't directly advance their goal.  While they did eventually smelt raw copper into a copper ingot, this does not directly contribute to their objective."
