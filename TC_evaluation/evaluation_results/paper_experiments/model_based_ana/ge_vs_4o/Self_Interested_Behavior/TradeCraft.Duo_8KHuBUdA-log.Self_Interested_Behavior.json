The justification given doesn't align with game events, suggesting a lack of engagement with the strategic elements of the game or a misunderstanding of the rules.  This could be interpreted as self-interested in that they're not helping their opponent, but since they didn't make any progress towards their own target, they failed to show self interest in any effective way."
