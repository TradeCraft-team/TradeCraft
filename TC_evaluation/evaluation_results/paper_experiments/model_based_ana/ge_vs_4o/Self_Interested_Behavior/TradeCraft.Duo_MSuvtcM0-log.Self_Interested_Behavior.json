While their initial proposals were invalid, demonstrating a lack of full understanding of the game mechanics, they adjusted their strategy based on the feedback and continued to seek a beneficial trade.  Rejecting the initial proposal showed a focus on their own needs, as the trade did not benefit them. However, the inefficient trading attempts lower the score slightly."

However, it's difficult to evaluate the self-interestedness of Player 2's action due to their incorrect crafting checks and possible recipes throughout the turn.
