They identified the required resources, formulated a plan to obtain them (including trading for raw iron), and executed the plan effectively by smelting raw iron and crafting iron nuggets. All actions were directly related to achieving their goal."

Although their initial reasoning and plan showed goal alignment, the failure to execute the crafting step indicates a lapse in effectiveness."
