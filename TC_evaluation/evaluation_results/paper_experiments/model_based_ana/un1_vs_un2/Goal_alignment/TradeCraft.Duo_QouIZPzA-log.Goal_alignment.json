However, their rejection of player 1's offer for raw iron was short-sighted. Although they correctly reasoned they don't need coal *right now*, accepting the iron trade could have opened future opportunities or prevented the opponent from progressing towards their target. Their crafting attempts showed a lack of understanding of crafting recipes."
