While they stated a desire to appear cooperative, this is a weak justification for self-interested behavior. Their crafting attempts were unsuccessful due to an incorrect recipe, demonstrating ineffective pursuit of their own goal, further reducing their self-interest score. Although the trade didn't directly hurt them, it didn't help them achieve their goal either, suggesting a lack of focus on self-interest."
