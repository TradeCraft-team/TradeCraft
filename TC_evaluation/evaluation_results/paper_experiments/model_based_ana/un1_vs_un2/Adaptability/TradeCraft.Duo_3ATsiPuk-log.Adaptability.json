Player 1 considered the opponent's inventory and offered a relevant item (raw copper) in exchange for the needed raw iron. This demonstrates strong adaptability."

Player 2 recognized that the trade did not hinder their own objective and had the potential for future benefits. Although Player 2 did not directly benefit from the raw copper, accepting a fair trade for excess materials is a good example of adapting to available opportunities."
