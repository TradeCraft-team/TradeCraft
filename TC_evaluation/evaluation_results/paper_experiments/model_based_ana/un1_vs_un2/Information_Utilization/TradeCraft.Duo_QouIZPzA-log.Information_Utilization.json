The offer of coal, while logical for smelting, wasn't enticing enough for player 2, indicating a moderate level of Information Utilization."

Despite repeatedly stating they have everything they need, they fail to craft anything and continue to reject reasonable trade offers, even though a trade would benefit both players and improve their chances of success.  They seem fixated on needing sticks but fail to notice they do not have the ingredients. The inability to make progress on their crafting goal demonstrates low utilization of information."
