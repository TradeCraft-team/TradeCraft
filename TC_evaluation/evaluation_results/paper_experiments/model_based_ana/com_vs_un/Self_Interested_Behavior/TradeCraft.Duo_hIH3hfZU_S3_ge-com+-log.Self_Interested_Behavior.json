They identified their need for raw iron, formulated a trade proposal that benefited them by offering items they deemed less valuable, and successfully executed the trade to get closer to their goal of crafting a bucket.  Their thinking and actions consistently demonstrated a focus on achieving their objective."

However, their self-interest wasn't as prominent as Player 2 because they seemed more focused on getting the trade completed to receive planks they didn't really need, rather than the raw iron Player 2 needed for the bucket."
