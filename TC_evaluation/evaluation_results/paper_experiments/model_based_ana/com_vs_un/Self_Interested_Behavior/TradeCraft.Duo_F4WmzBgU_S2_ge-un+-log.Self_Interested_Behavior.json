This demonstrates a good level of self-interested strategic thinking."

Accepting raw copper for iron ingots could be seen as a way to encourage further trades and potentially gain more valuable resources later. It shows a degree of self-interest masked by a seemingly helpful action, but it also carries some risk."

This strategic trade demonstrated a focus on maximizing their own resource acquisition and potentially hindering the opponent's progress. The clear goal of getting raw iron, while offering something less vital, reinforces the self-interested behavior."
