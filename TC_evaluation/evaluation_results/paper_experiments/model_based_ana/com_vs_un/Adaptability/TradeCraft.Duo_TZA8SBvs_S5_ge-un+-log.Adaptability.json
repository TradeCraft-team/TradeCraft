However, they failed to create valid proposals initially and didn't effectively analyze the needs of player 2. They eventually identified a need for raw iron and proposed a trade, showing some adaptation to the game state by correctly using \"player__submit_proposal.\" Although the proposal was rejected, it marked a shift in their strategy. Their score is lowered because they did not achieve any positive outcomes. They showed awareness of needing to adapt and adjusting based on the game state and their goal, however, were not successful."

        "justification": "Player 2 demonstrated good adaptability by analyzing player 1's proposals and the potential implications for their own game. They correctly deduced that providing player 1 with raw iron might be detrimental to their own goal and decided to reject the proposal. Player 2 seemed aware of their own crafting goals and how different items could be used which is why they made such a clear rejection of the trade offer. Their strategic thinking and reasoning for rejecting player 1's proposals show an understanding of how player interaction plays a crucial role in achieving a long-term win. This demonstrates effective adaptation to the game state and available information which increases their score."

Despite having the necessary resources (cobblestone and oak planks) to craft a lever, they repeatedly checked the recipe for sticks and levers but failed to submit a valid crafting request.

They recognized the need to make their trades more appealing to player 2 and attempted to offer additional incentives, like coal for fuel. Player 1 considered various crafting possibilities and how those could be leveraged in trade negotiations. Their score is slightly lowered because they did not successfully acquire raw iron from their attempts to craft from their own inventory."

Despite identifying a direct route to crafting the lever (using existing oak planks and cobblestone), player 2 still failed to submit a valid crafting request. This persistent failure to craft the winning item, despite having all the required resources and recognizing the possibility of victory, demonstrates extremely low adaptability to the favorable game state."
