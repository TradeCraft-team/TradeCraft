They correctly assessed the value of their own items and offered less crucial resources like cherry planks and cobblestone in exchange.

They immediately recognized the value of the trade proposed by Player 2, as it provided them with cobblestone needed for their stone shovel. They checked the recipe for a stone shovel, confirming the necessity of cobblestone and then accepted the trade, which brought them closer to achieving their goal. Their thought process and actions were entirely focused on acquiring the necessary materials for their target item."
