## üåÄ Turn 1 start!
----------------------------------------

### üß† `player 1 ` THINKS:
- I need to craft shears.  Shears require 2 iron ingots. I have one iron ingot. My opponent has 5 raw iron.  I could offer them some of my resources in exchange for some raw iron so I can smelt it into iron ingots.  Let's check the recipe for shears to be sure.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1  checked the item info of craft: **shears**.


### üß† `player 1 ` THINKS:
- Okay, I need two iron ingots.  I'll offer my opponent my coal and cobblestone in exchange for two raw iron.  That seems like a fair trade.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1  submit a proposal to Player 2 , request [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:coal * 1, minecraft:cobblestone * 1, ] together with a text message: I'm trying to craft shears.  Would you be willing to trade 2 raw iron for my coal and cobblestone?


### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
Player 2  decided to reject the proposal with a text message: Maximum number of iterations reached without outputting correct information


### üß† `player 1 ` THINKS:
- My target is shears, which requires 2 iron ingots. I only have 1 iron ingot. My opponent has 5 raw iron, which can be smelted into 5 iron ingots. I need to get at least one more iron ingot from them.  They have 2 raw copper, which I could use, but it's not essential for my goal. I have coal, which they might need for smelting their raw iron. I can offer to trade my coal for their raw iron.
- Confirming the recipe for shears.
- Checking how to obtain more iron ingots.  <current status>
- I will offer my coal for 2 of their raw iron. This should be a fair trade, as they need fuel to smelt the raw iron, and I need the iron ingots to craft shears. If they refuse, I will try offering coal for 1 raw iron.

### üß† `Player 2 ` THINKS:
- ** My target is to craft 1 torch. To craft a torch, I need coal and a stick. Currently, I have cobblestone, oak planks, raw copper, and raw iron. I need to find out how to craft a stick and check if I can trade for coal.

- ** Player 1  mentioned crafting shears, which require iron ingots. They might need raw iron to smelt into iron ingots. I should be cautious about trading raw iron, as it might help Player 1  achieve their target.
- ** I need to craft sticks from oak planks and trade for coal. I should propose a trade that benefits me without giving Player 1  an advantage.
- ** I have the recipe for crafting sticks from oak planks. I can craft sticks and then focus on acquiring coal through trade.
- ** I should propose a trade to Player 1 , offering items that don't help them craft their target item. I can offer raw copper or cobblestone in exchange for coal.
- ** I think I have a good plan.

This is straightforward and doesn't require any additional items.  2. **Obtaining Coal:** I need to find a way to obtain coal. Since player 1  doesn't have coal, I need to explore other options, such as crafting it from other items or trading with player 1  for items that can help me obtain coal.  3. **Trading Strategy:** I should consider offering items that player 1  might need, such as raw iron or raw copper, in exchange for items that can help me obtain coal.  4. **Opponent's Strategy:** Player 1  mentioned needing iron ingots for crafting shears. I should consider this when making trade offers, as it might give me leverage in negotiations.

Player 2  offered 2 raw iron for 1 iron ingot, which suggests they might need iron ingots too.  I need to make a more enticing offer.  <current status>

Player 2  offered 2 raw iron for 1 iron ingot, suggesting they might need iron ingots too.  Offering more might not be the solution. I need to figure out what Player 2 's target might be.  They have oak planks, cobblestone, raw copper, and raw iron.  <current status>
- Maybe Player 2  is trying to craft stone tools.  They have cobblestone and could be trying to get iron for an iron pickaxe.  I'll offer them my iron ingot for 3 raw iron. This gives them enough for a pickaxe and me enough to make shears.

Player 2  offered 2 raw iron for 1 iron ingot, suggesting they might need iron ingots too, but clearly not enough to give up 3 raw iron.  They have oak planks, cobblestone, raw copper, and raw iron.  I need to make a trade that benefits them more than it costs me.  <current status>
- I'll offer my copper ingot, cherry planks, AND cobblestone for just 2 raw iron. This is a very generous offer and might be enough to persuade Player 2 , even if they need the iron themselves.  It's a risk, but I'm running out of options.
- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `Player 2 ` THINKS:
- My team's target is to craft a torch. To craft a torch in Minecraft, I need coal and a stick. I currently have sticks but no coal. I need to find out if player 1  has coal or if I can craft it from the items I have. I should check the crafting recipe for coal.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
Player 2  checked the item info of craft: **coal**.


### üß† `Player 2 ` THINKS:
- The information indicates that coal can be crafted from a coal block, but I don't have a coal block. I need to find another way to obtain coal. Since player 1  doesn't have coal either, I should consider trading for items that might help me indirectly obtain coal or craft a torch. I should check if there are any other items that can be used to craft a torch or if there are any items that player 1  might have that could be useful for crafting a torch.

Would you be interested in trading it for two raw copper? It might help us both in crafting or trading in future turns.


### üß† `player 1 ` THINKS:
- My target is shears, which requires two iron ingots. I already have one iron ingot and two raw iron.  Trading my copper ingot for two raw copper doesn't directly help me achieve my goal. However, raw copper can be smelted into copper ingots, which might be useful for future trades.  Player 2  might need the copper ingot for their target, and having more raw materials could be beneficial for bartering later.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1  checked the item info of craft: **shears**.


### üß† `player 1 ` THINKS:

- Double checking the recipe for shears.
- Seeing what I can craft now.  <current status>
- I can smelt my raw iron into an iron ingot, but I need fuel.  I'll try trading for Player 2 's iron ingot first. If that fails, I'll propose a trade for their raw iron and then smelt it using my own raw iron as fuel. If both trades fail, I'll wait for another opportunity.

### üß† `player 1 ` THINKS:
- My target is shears (2 iron ingots). I have 1 iron ingot, 9 iron nuggets, and 2 raw iron. Player 2  has 1 iron ingot, 1 raw iron, and 2 raw copper. I need one more iron ingot. Trading is the fastest route.
- Confirming shears recipe.
- Checking craftable items.  <current status>
- I can smelt my raw iron, but need fuel.  Prioritize trading for Player 2 's iron ingot. If that fails, I'll try for their raw iron and smelt it using my own raw iron as fuel (inefficient, but a backup plan).

### üß† `Player 2 ` THINKS:
- My target item is a torch. To craft a torch, I need coal and a stick. Currently, I have sticks but no coal. I need to find a way to obtain coal, either through crafting or trading. Let's analyze the situation and plan accordingly.
- I need to understand the recipe for crafting a torch to ensure I have the correct items and amounts. Let's check the recipe for a torch.
- Coal is essential for crafting a torch. I need to find out if I can craft coal from the items I currently have or if I need to trade for it.
- I need to see if there are any possible recipes I can craft with my current hand that might lead to obtaining coal or any other useful items.
- I think I have a good plan.

- My target is shears, which requires 2 iron ingots. I have 1 iron ingot, 9 iron nuggets, and 2 raw iron. Player 2  has 1 iron ingot, 1 raw iron, and 2 raw copper.  The quickest path to victory is trading for their iron ingot.
- Confirming the shears recipe.
- Checking my crafting options.  <current status>
- I can smelt my raw iron, but I need fuel. Trading for Player 2 's iron ingot is the priority. If that fails, I can offer my raw iron for theirs, then smelt it using my remaining raw iron as fuel. This is less efficient, but a viable backup.
