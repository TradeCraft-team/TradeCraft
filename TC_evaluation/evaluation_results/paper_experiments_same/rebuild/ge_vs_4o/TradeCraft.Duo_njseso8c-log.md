## 🌀 Turn 1 start!
----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `Player 2 ` THINKS:
- To achieve my team's goal of crafting a bucket, I need to understand the crafting recipe for a bucket and determine what resources I need. I currently have an iron ingot, which is a key component for crafting a bucket in Minecraft. However, I need to confirm the exact recipe to ensure I have all necessary items or can trade for them.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
Player 2  checked the item info of craft: **bucket**.


### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
Player 2  submit a proposal to player 1 , request [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:coal * 1, ] together with a text message: Hi player 1 ! I see you have some raw iron, and I could really use a couple to work towards my crafting goal. I'm offering coal, which could be useful for your smelting needs. Let's help each other out!


### 🧠 `player 1 ` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a stone shovel.  A stone shovel requires cobblestone and sticks. I already have cobblestone. Sticks are crafted from planks. I have oak planks, so I can make sticks.  I don't need coal for this.  Trading away raw iron doesn't hurt my plan.
- Accepting the trade gives me coal, which I could potentially use later for smelting if needed. It might be beneficial to have some fuel on hand.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1  checked the item info of craft: **stone_shovel**.


### 🧠 `player 1 ` THINKS:
- I have enough oak planks to make sticks, and I have the cobblestone.  The coal isn't necessary for my goal, but it could be useful later.  Accepting the trade seems slightly beneficial.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1  decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Thanks!  I can use the coal.


### 🖥 Server Event: `server__update_all_hands`

- Confirming the stick recipe.  Also checking if there's a more direct way to get a stone_shovel.
- Okay, confirmed.  Need planks for sticks, then sticks and cobblestone for the shovel. I have enough oak_planks and cobblestone.  I traded away some raw_iron for coal, which I don't need right now.  Hopefully, Player 2  needs it for their target.  <current status>
- I have everything I need to craft the stone_shovel.

### 🧠 `Player 2 ` THINKS:
- ** My target is to craft a bucket. To craft a bucket in Minecraft, I need 3 iron ingots. Currently, I have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron. I need to smelt the raw iron into iron ingots using a furnace, which requires fuel. I have cherry planks that can be used as fuel. I need to check if I can craft a furnace with the items I have.

### 🧠 `Player 2 ` THINKS:
- I need to craft a bucket, which requires iron ingots. I currently have 2 iron ingots and 1 raw iron. To craft a bucket, I need 3 iron ingots. I can smelt raw iron into iron ingots using a furnace, but I need fuel like coal to do so. Player 1  has coal, which I need. I should propose a trade that helps me get coal from player 1 .

### 🧠 `player 1 ` THINKS:

- I will check possible recipes from my hand.

I need to smelt the raw iron into an iron ingot using the furnace, which requires fuel. I have coal, which can be used as fuel. I need to check if I can craft the bucket with the items I have after smelting the raw iron.
- ** I need to confirm the recipe for crafting a bucket and ensure I have the necessary items. Once I have the recipe, I can plan the crafting steps accordingly.
- ** I have confirmed that I need three iron ingots to craft a bucket. I currently have two iron ingots and one raw iron, which can be smelted into an iron ingot using coal as fuel. I will smelt the raw iron first and then craft the bucket.
- ** I need to check the possible recipes I can craft with the items I currently have in hand. This will help me determine if I can proceed with smelting the raw iron and crafting the bucket.
- ** I think I have a good plan.

### 🧠 `player 1 ` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I need 2 sticks and 1 cobblestone. I have 2 cobblestone and 1 oak_planks. I need another oak_planks to craft 2 sticks. Player 2  has no oak_planks.  This is problematic. I need to find another way to get sticks or a stone shovel.  <current status>
- I will check possible recipes from my hand to see if there are any alternative crafting paths.
- I will also check the recipes for stick and stone_shovel again to make sure I haven't missed anything.
- I need to consider what Player 2  might be crafting.  They traded for coal and raw iron.  Perhaps they are making shears or an iron tool.  Knowing their target might help me devise a better trading strategy.
- I think I have a plan.

- I will also check the recipes for stick and stone_shovel again to make sure I haven't missed anything.  I'll also check recipes for other tools that might be craftable, especially ones I can make with just cobblestone.

Knowing their target might help me devise a better trading strategy.  If they are making shears, they might need more iron.  If they are making an iron tool, they might need more iron or perhaps they are hoping to trade for sticks.
