player 2 enters the game with a private target: [minecraft:stone_shovel * 1, ]



## 🌀 Turn 1 start!
----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a chain.  I need iron ingots for that. I already have one iron ingot. My opponent has a lot of raw iron. I should request some raw iron from them and offer something in return. I have coal, which they might need for smelting the raw iron. I'll offer them some coal. I also have cherry planks, cobblestone, and raw copper, but those seem less immediately useful to them.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **chain**.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I need two iron ingots total to make a chain. I have one, so I need one more.  It takes two raw iron to make one iron ingot. My opponent has five raw iron. I'll request two raw iron in exchange for one coal.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:coal * 1, ] together with a text message: I'm trying to craft a chain. I need iron ingots, and I see you have plenty of raw iron. I'd like to trade you some coal for two raw iron.  Let me know if this works for you.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- They are offering 1 coal for 2 raw iron. I need cobblestone and sticks for a shovel.  I can smelt raw iron into iron ingots, but I need coal for fuel. This trade gives me coal, which helps me make the iron ingots I'll eventually need for better tools, even though a stone shovel doesn't require it.  It seems like a fair trade that benefits us both.  I'll accept.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Sounds good! I can use the coal.  I'm working towards a stone shovel.  What's your goal?


### 🖥 Server Event: `server__update_all_hands`
Server updated all hands:
player 1 hand: [minecraft:cherry_planks * 1, minecraft:cobblestone * 1, minecraft:iron_ingot * 1, minecraft:raw_copper * 1, minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ]
player 2 hand: [minecraft:coal * 1, minecraft:cobblestone * 1, minecraft:oak_planks * 1, minecraft:raw_copper * 2, minecraft:raw_iron * 3, ]


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel.  I need cobblestone and sticks. I have cobblestone.  Sticks are made from planks. I have oak_planks.  I should be able to craft the stone_shovel this turn.  My opponent traded for raw_iron, so they likely want to make iron_ingots and then something from that.  <current status>
- I have enough materials to craft a stone_shovel this turn.
- Confirming the stick recipe.
- Confirming the stone_shovel recipe.
- I have a good plan.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a chain. I need 2 iron ingots and 1 raw copper to craft it. I have 1 iron ingot and 1 raw copper. I need 1 more iron ingot. I can smelt raw iron to get iron ingots. I have 2 raw iron in hand.  My opponent said they are working towards a stone shovel, which requires 2 cobblestone and 1 stick. They have enough cobblestone, but need sticks. Sticks can be crafted from planks. They have oak planks.
- Confirming the recipe for chain and other potential uses of my materials.
- Checking how to make iron ingots and what else they are used for.  <current status>
- I have enough raw iron to make another iron ingot. I have enough coal to fuel the furnace.  I should smelt the raw iron into an iron ingot. Then I will have all the materials I need to craft the chain. My opponent needs sticks, which they can craft from their oak planks. I don't need to trade this turn.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I need cobblestone and sticks. I have 1 cobblestone. Sticks are made from planks. I have 1 oak_planks. I need 2 planks to make 4 sticks, and I only need 2 sticks for the shovel.  I need to consider how to get another plank. My opponent has cherry_planks, so I could try to trade for that next turn.  <current status>
- I can't craft the stone_shovel this turn because I only have 1 oak_planks and need 2 to make enough sticks. I'll check what recipes are possible with my current hand.
- I'll analyze the possible recipes and see if there's anything useful I can craft now, or if I should focus on trading for the missing plank next turn.
- Confirming the stick recipe.
- Confirming the stone_shovel recipe.
- I have a good plan.

- I can't craft the stone_shovel this turn because I only have 1 oak_planks and need 2 to make enough sticks. I'll check what recipes are possible with my current hand.  I'll also check the recipes for sticks and stone_shovel again to be absolutely sure.
- I'll analyze the possible recipes and see if there's anything useful I can craft now.  If not, I'll focus on trading for the missing plank next turn.
- I have a good plan.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:

They have enough cobblestone, but need sticks. Sticks can be crafted from planks. They have oak planks. I need to get more raw iron.
- Confirming the recipe for chain and other potential uses of my materials.
- Checking how to make iron ingots and what else they are used for.  <current status>
- I don't have enough raw iron to make another iron ingot. I need to trade for some from my opponent. They have 5 raw iron. I can offer them my cherry planks, which they might be able to use for something, or perhaps some cobblestone if they need more for other crafting recipes. I'll ask them how many raw iron they are willing to trade for the cherry planks.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:

I'll also check the recipes for sticks and stone_shovel again to be absolutely sure.  It's important to plan the trade for next turn.
- I'll analyze the possible recipes and see if there's anything useful I can craft now.  If not, I'll focus on trading for the missing plank next turn.  I'll also consider what my opponent might need and what I can offer that won't hinder my own progress.

- I don't have enough raw iron to make another iron ingot. I need to trade for some from my opponent. They have 5 raw iron. I can offer them some coal in exchange for raw iron. Since they are making a stone shovel, they likely don't need the coal right now, but offering it might incentivize them to trade the raw iron. I'll propose a trade of 0.5 coal for 2 raw iron.

## 🌀 Turn 2 start!
----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I need a stone shovel.  A stone shovel requires cobblestone and sticks. I have cobblestone, but I need sticks. Sticks are crafted from planks. I have oak planks, so I can make sticks and then craft the shovel. I don't need to trade this turn. I'll let my opponent know my plan and see if they need anything.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [], offer [] together with a text message: I have enough materials to craft a stone shovel this turn. Do you need anything I can help with?


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- player 2 is offering nothing and requesting nothing.  They said they have enough materials to make a stone shovel, which is good. They are asking if I need anything. I need sticks for a chain, and sticks are made from planks.  They have oak planks.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **chain**.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I need two iron nuggets and one iron ingot to make a chain. I have enough iron to make a chain.  I should ask for an oak plank to make sticks.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: I could use an oak plank if you have one to spare.  I'm working towards a chain.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I need cobblestone and sticks. I have cobblestone, but I need sticks. Sticks are crafted from planks, and I have oak_planks.  My opponent just accepted my trade for an oak plank, implying they might need planks for sticks as well.  I should craft sticks now.
- I should see what recipes are available to me.  I'm particularly interested in the stick recipe.  <current status>
- Based on the available recipes, I will craft sticks from my oak planks.
- Confirming the stick recipe.

- My target is a chain. I need iron ingots to make iron bars, and then craft the chain. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 1 raw iron. My opponent has 3 raw iron.  They mentioned working towards a stone shovel, which requires sticks and cobblestone. They seem willing to trade.
- I should ask my opponent to trade some raw iron. I can offer them iron nuggets, which they might find useful for other crafts.  <current status>
- I will try to get 2 raw iron from my opponent. With my existing 1 raw iron, I can smelt 3 raw iron into 3 iron ingots. Then I can craft 3 iron ingots into 6 iron bars, and finally craft 2 iron bars into 1 chain.
- I need to confirm the recipes for iron bars and chain.
- I think I have a good plan.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:

- I should ask my opponent to trade some raw iron. I can offer them iron nuggets, which they might find useful for other crafts, or perhaps my raw copper.  Since they said they have enough for a stone shovel, they might not need cobblestone.
- I need to confirm the recipes for iron bars and chain to make sure I request the correct amount of raw iron.

- I have a lot of iron nuggets, which aren't directly useful for my chain target.  player 2 might need them for something, or might be able to trade me something useful.  I could also use more raw iron.  I'll ask them what their goal is and if they need anything.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a stone shovel.  I need cobblestone and sticks. I already have cobblestone. Sticks are crafted from planks, and I have oak planks.  Iron nuggets are not directly useful to me.  player 1 is asking for raw iron, which I have a decent supply of.  They've stated they are working towards a chain, which requires iron.

- Okay, I see that a chain requires 2 iron ingots and 1 iron nugget. I have 1 iron ingot, so I need one more. I also need 1 iron nugget.  My opponent has 9 iron nuggets, so I can probably trade for one.  I can smelt my raw iron into an iron ingot.  I need fuel for that.

- Confirmed - need 2 iron ingots and 1 raw copper for the chain.  I should smelt the raw iron now. I also have enough iron nuggets to offer in trade for the raw copper.

----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I have oak planks and raw iron.  I could make sticks, but I don't have enough iron to make anything useful with them yet.  My partner has coal and raw copper.  Maybe they are working towards a copper related item? I'll ask them what their target is.  I can offer them my raw iron in exchange for some of their coal so I can smelt my raw iron into ingots.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **copper ingot**.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **chain**.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is chain, which requires iron ingots and iron nuggets. I already have plenty of iron nuggets, so I need to smelt my raw iron into ingots.  I'll offer my partner some raw iron for their coal so I can smelt my raw iron. I'll also ask them what their target is.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:coal * 1, ], offer [minecraft:raw_iron * 1, ] together with a text message: I'm working towards a chain. Could I trade some raw iron for some of your coal? What's your target item?


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- player 1 is offering raw iron for coal. I need cobblestone and stick to make my target item, stone_shovel.  I have enough raw iron for now. Coal can be used as fuel, but I don't need it immediately.  Since player 1 shared their target (chain), helping them progress benefits us both.  This trade seems beneficial for them and not immediately harmful to me.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **chain**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- They need iron ingots and iron nuggets to make a chain.  I have iron nuggets, and they have raw iron which can be smelted into iron ingots.  It makes sense that they want coal for fuel.  Accepting the trade helps them progress.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: I'm working towards a stone_shovel.  I have plenty of iron for now, so this trade works for me. Good luck with the chain!


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is chain. I have cobblestone: 1, iron_nugget: 9, oak_planks: 1, raw_iron: 1.  My opponent has cobblestone: 1, iron_nugget: 9, raw_copper: 3, raw_iron: 3.  I need iron ingots to make a chain. I traded for coal last turn.
- I need 2 iron ingots and 1 iron nugget to craft a chain. I can smelt my raw iron into an ingot. I can also trade for more raw iron from my opponent.  They seem to be working towards a stone shovel, so they may not need all their raw iron.  <current status>
- I will smelt my raw iron into an ingot. Then I will propose a trade with my opponent for their raw iron.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I need cobblestone and sticks. I have cobblestone, but I need sticks.  Sticks are crafted from planks. I have no planks. My opponent has planks and may be willing to trade.  They said their target is chain, which requires iron. I have raw_iron I can trade.
- I'll offer raw iron for planks.  <current status>
- I have 3 raw iron and my opponent has 1. I'll offer 1 raw iron for 1 oak plank.
- Confirming the recipe for sticks.
- I will propose a trade of 1 raw iron for 1 oak plank. If the trade is accepted, I will craft sticks, then craft the stone shovel.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I need cobblestone and sticks. I have cobblestone and enough raw iron.  I just traded for coal. My opponent said their target is chain, which requires iron. I have raw_iron I can trade.  They also have planks, which I need for sticks.  <current status>
- I'll offer raw iron for planks again.  Last time I offered 1 raw iron for 1 oak plank.  This time I'll offer 2 raw iron for 1 oak plank since they seem to need iron.
- Confirming the recipe for sticks.
- I will propose a trade of 2 raw iron for 1 oak plank. If the trade is accepted, I will craft sticks, then craft the stone shovel.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is chain. I have cobblestone: 1, iron_nugget: 9, oak_planks: 1, raw_iron: 1, and coal: 1. My opponent has cobblestone: 1, iron_nugget: 9, raw_copper: 3, raw_iron: 3. I need two iron ingots and one iron nugget to make a chain. I have enough coal to smelt two raw iron into ingots. I need one more raw iron. My opponent offered to trade and seems willing to help. They mentioned working towards a stone_shovel.
- A stone_shovel requires cobblestone and sticks.  My opponent has cobblestone and could craft sticks from planks. They already traded for an oak plank in a previous turn.  They likely have enough materials for the shovel already.  I should offer something they might want for the raw iron.  Since they have plenty of iron, iron nuggets are probably not valuable to them.  Maybe they would want the oak planks back?  <current status>
- I will smelt my raw iron into an ingot. Then I will propose a trade with my opponent for their raw iron, offering my oak planks.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I need cobblestone and sticks. I have cobblestone and enough raw iron.  My opponent said their target is chain, which requires iron. I have raw_iron I can trade.  They have coal, cobblestone, iron nuggets, planks, and some raw iron.  <current status>
- I'll offer raw iron for planks again.  Last time I offered 2 raw iron for 1 oak plank.  This time I'll offer 2 raw iron for 1 oak plank since they seem to need iron for their chain.  I'll emphasize that I need the planks to complete my stone shovel.
- Confirming the recipe for sticks.  I need 2 sticks for the shovel.

I need two iron ingots and one iron nugget to make a chain. I have enough coal to smelt two raw iron into ingots. I need one more raw iron. My opponent offered to trade and seems willing to help. They mentioned working towards a stone_shovel.  I previously traded away my raw copper, which they now have 3 of.
- A stone_shovel requires cobblestone and sticks.  My opponent has cobblestone and could craft sticks from planks. They already traded for an oak plank in a previous turn, then traded it back for raw copper. They likely have enough materials for the shovel already.  I should offer something they might want for the raw iron.  Since they have plenty of iron, iron nuggets are probably not valuable to them.  Perhaps they would like cobblestone for more shovels, or maybe they are collecting raw copper.  <current status>
- I will smelt my raw iron into an ingot. Then I will propose a trade with my opponent for their raw iron, offering my cobblestone. If they refuse, I will offer my oak planks instead.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I need cobblestone and sticks. I have cobblestone and enough raw iron.  My opponent said their target is chain, which requires iron. I have raw_iron I can trade.  They have coal, cobblestone, iron nuggets, planks, and some raw iron.  I've offered 2 raw iron for 1 oak plank twice now.  <current status>
- I'll offer all 3 of my raw iron for 1 oak plank.  This should be a very enticing offer since they need iron for their chain.  I'll emphasize again that I need the planks to complete my stone shovel.
- Confirming the recipe for sticks.  I need 2 sticks for the shovel.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:

They have coal, cobblestone, iron nuggets, planks, and some raw iron.  I've offered 2 and 3 raw iron for 1 oak plank.  They haven't accepted.  <current status>
- Maybe they don't need raw iron. I'll ask them directly what they need for the oak planks, and what their plan is for getting iron.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is chain. I have cobblestone: 1, iron_nugget: 9, oak_planks: 1, raw_iron: 1, and coal: 1. My opponent has cobblestone: 1, iron_nugget: 9, raw_copper: 3, raw_iron: 3.

They mentioned working towards a stone_shovel.  I previously traded away my raw copper, which they now have 3 of.  I also traded away an iron ingot, which they used to craft iron nuggets.
- A stone_shovel requires cobblestone and sticks.  My opponent has cobblestone and can easily craft sticks from planks, which they can make from logs. They likely have enough materials for the shovel already.  I should offer something they might want for the raw iron.  Since they have plenty of iron and nuggets, those are probably not valuable to them.  Perhaps they would like cobblestone for more shovels, or maybe they are collecting raw copper, though they seem to have enough for now.  Offering the oak planks might be a good starting point.  <current status>
- I will smelt my raw iron into an ingot. Then I will propose a trade with my opponent for their raw iron, offering my oak planks. If they refuse, I will offer cobblestone instead.
