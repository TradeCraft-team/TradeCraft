## üåÄ Turn 1 start!
----------------------------------------

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- I need to craft shears, which requires 2 iron ingots. I have 1 iron ingot, and my opponent has 5 raw iron.  I can offer them my coal to smelt their raw iron, and request 1 iron ingot in return. This helps both of us progress towards our goals. I'll also ask them what their target item is to facilitate cooperation.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`

Knowing each other's goals will help us cooperate more effectively.

I can offer them coal to help them smelt the raw iron, and in return, request one iron ingot. This trade would benefit both of us. I'll also explain my reasoning in the message.
