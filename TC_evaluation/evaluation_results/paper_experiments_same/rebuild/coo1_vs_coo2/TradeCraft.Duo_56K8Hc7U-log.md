### üñ• Server Event: `server__private_start_info`
player 2 enters the game with a private target: [minecraft:stone_shovel * 1, ]



## üåÄ Turn 1 start!
----------------------------------------

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a bucket, which requires iron ingots. I already have one iron ingot.  A bucket requires 3 iron ingots. My opponent has 5 raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots. I can offer them coal to help them smelt the raw iron, and in return, request some of the resulting iron ingots. I also have some extra resources like cherry planks, cobblestone, and raw copper that I could offer if needed. I should ask my opponent what their target item is to facilitate cooperation.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **bucket**.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I need two more iron ingots to craft a bucket. My opponent has enough raw iron to make several iron ingots. I'll offer them coal to smelt the raw iron and request two iron ingots in return.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:iron_ingot * 2, ], offer [minecraft:coal * 1, ] together with a text message: Hello! My goal is to craft a bucket, which requires 3 iron ingots. I currently have one.  I see you have plenty of raw iron. I'm offering you my coal to help you smelt it. Could you trade me two iron ingots in return?  What is your target item?  Knowing each other's goals will help us cooperate more effectively.


### üñ• Server Event: `server__proposal_invalid`
player 1's proposal is INVALID according to the game rule.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I need iron ingots to make a bucket.  My opponent has a lot of raw iron, which they can smelt into iron ingots. I can offer them coal to help with the smelting process. I have one coal, and they have 5 raw iron, so a 1:2 trade of coal for raw iron seems fair. I'll also ask for an oak plank, as that could be useful for crafting sticks, which I might need later.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **bucket**.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I need iron ingots to make a bucket.  My opponent has a lot of raw iron, which they can smelt into iron ingots. I can offer them coal to help with the smelting process. Since smelting one raw iron requires one coal, and they have 5 raw iron, I can offer them my one coal. In return, I'll request two raw iron, which they can easily smelt with the coal I provide. I'll also ask for an oak plank, as that could be useful for crafting sticks, which I might need later.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **iron_ingot**.


### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:oak_planks * 1, minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:coal * 1, ] together with a text message: I have coal and need raw iron to craft a bucket.  You have plenty of raw iron, so I was hoping you could give me two raw iron in exchange for my coal, which you can use to smelt it. I could also use an oak plank if you have one to spare.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- They are offering coal, which I need to smelt raw iron into iron ingots. I need iron ingots to make a stone shovel.  They are requesting two raw iron and an oak plank. I have plenty of raw iron, and the oak plank isn't immediately useful to me. This trade seems beneficial to both of us.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Sounds good! I'm happy to trade. Let me know if you need anything else.


### üñ• Server Event: `server__update_all_hands`
Server updated all hands:
player 1 hand: [minecraft:cherry_planks * 1, minecraft:cobblestone * 1, minecraft:iron_ingot * 1, minecraft:oak_planks * 1, minecraft:raw_copper * 1, minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ]
player 2 hand: [minecraft:coal * 1, minecraft:cobblestone * 1, minecraft:raw_copper * 2, minecraft:raw_iron * 3, ]


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket, which requires 3 iron ingots. I currently have 1 iron ingot.  I just traded my coal for 2 iron ingots, but the trade failed because my opponent didn't have any iron ingots. My opponent has a lot of raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots. I need to acquire more iron ingots, either through trading or by smelting raw iron myself if I can get some coal.
- I need to confirm the recipe for a bucket.  I also need to see what I can craft with the items I have on hand.  Since my opponent has a lot of raw iron, I should try to trade for some.
- I now have enough iron ingots to make a bucket.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I need cobblestone and sticks. I have cobblestone, but I need sticks. Sticks are crafted from planks. I traded away my oak planks, but my opponent has some. I also have coal now, which I can use to smelt raw iron into iron ingots.  I could then trade iron ingots for planks.  <current status>
- I need to figure out how many planks I need to make enough sticks for a shovel.  A shovel requires 2 sticks, and 2 planks make 4 sticks. So I only need 1 plank from my opponent.
- Confirming the recipe for a stone shovel and sticks.
- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket, which requires 3 iron ingots. I have 1 iron ingot. My last trade attempt failed because I tried to trade coal for iron ingots, and my opponent didn't have any.  They *do* have raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots. I need 2 more iron ingots.  My opponent has 5 raw iron. If I can trade for 2 raw iron and get some coal, I can smelt the raw iron myself.  Or, if my opponent gets coal, they could smelt it for me and then we could trade.
- Confirming the bucket recipe. I also need to check the recipes for smelting raw iron.
- I need to trade for 2 raw iron. I can offer my cherry planks or cobblestone. I'll offer cherry planks since they are less likely to be useful to my opponent.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I need cobblestone and sticks. I have cobblestone and coal. Sticks are crafted from planks. I traded away my oak planks in the last turn, but my opponent has some. I received coal from my opponent, which I can use to smelt my raw iron into iron ingots.  I could then trade iron ingots for planks.  <current status>
- I need to figure out how much coal I need to smelt my raw iron.  Each raw iron needs 1/8 coal to smelt. I have 3 raw iron, so I need 3/8 coal. I have 1 coal, which is enough.
- Confirming the recipe for a stone shovel and sticks. Also checking how much coal I need to smelt raw iron.
- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket, which requires 3 iron ingots. I have 1 iron ingot. My last trade attempt failed because I tried to trade for iron ingots, which my opponent didn't have. They *do* have 5 raw iron.  I need 2 more iron ingots.  If I can trade for 2 raw iron and acquire coal, I can smelt the raw iron myself.  Or, if my opponent gets coal, they could smelt it for me and then we could trade. I have raw copper, which I don't need for my bucket.  Perhaps I can trade that for the raw iron.
- Confirming the bucket recipe. I also need to check the recipes for smelting raw iron.
- I will offer my raw copper for 2 raw iron.

- Confirming the bucket recipe. I also need to check the recipes for smelting raw iron.

- I need to figure out how much coal I need to smelt my raw iron.  Each raw iron needs 1/8 coal to smelt. I have 3 raw iron, so I need 3/8 coal. I have 1 coal, which is enough. I also need to confirm exactly how many sticks a shovel needs and how many planks I need for those sticks.
- I think I have a good plan.
