### üñ• Server Event: `server__private_start_info`
player 1 enters the game with a private target: [minecraft:stone_shovel * 1, ]



## üåÄ Turn 1 start!
----------------------------------------

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a bucket, which requires iron ingots. I have one iron ingot, but need two more. My opponent has a lot of raw iron. I can offer them coal to smelt their raw iron, which benefits both of us.  I also need more information about their goal to better coordinate our efforts.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **bucket**.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- I'll offer them coal in exchange for some raw iron.  I'll also ask them what their target item is so we can work together more effectively.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:coal * 1, ] together with a text message: I'm trying to craft a bucket, so I need more iron. I see you have quite a bit of raw iron, so I'm offering my coal to help you smelt it.  Could you also tell me what your target item is so we can coordinate our crafting efforts?


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- They are offering coal for raw iron.  I need cobblestone and sticks for a stone shovel.  Coal would help me smelt the raw iron into iron ingots, which I don't need for the shovel.  However, player 2 asked about my target item, which suggests they are playing cooperatively. Sharing information will help us both reach our goals faster.  The coal will be useful if I need other iron tools later. Accepting the trade seems like a good way to build trust and potentially get information in return.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **stone_shovel**.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I need cobblestone and sticks.  Trading for coal doesn't directly help me get those, but it does help player 2, and building a positive relationship is important for this cooperative game. I'll accept the trade and share my target item.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: I'm happy to trade. My target is a stone_shovel. What's yours?


### üñ• Server Event: `server__update_all_hands`
Server updated all hands:
player 2 hand: [minecraft:cherry_planks * 1, minecraft:cobblestone * 1, minecraft:iron_ingot * 1, minecraft:raw_copper * 1, minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ]
player 1 hand: [minecraft:coal * 1, minecraft:cobblestone * 1, minecraft:oak_planks * 1, minecraft:raw_copper * 2, minecraft:raw_iron * 3, ]


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket. I need 3 iron ingots to craft it. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron.  My opponent has 3 raw iron. If I get 1 raw iron from them, I can smelt my 3 raw iron into 3 iron ingots and craft the bucket. I traded my coal for their raw iron, which seems like a fair trade since they might need fuel for smelting. They said their target is a stone_shovel, which requires cobblestone and sticks. They have cobblestone and planks to make sticks, so they should be able to craft it now.
- I need to confirm the recipe for iron ingot.  <current status>
- I will smelt the raw iron into iron ingots and then craft the bucket.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I need cobblestone and sticks. I have cobblestone.  Sticks are crafted from planks. I have oak_planks.  I traded some raw_iron for coal in the last turn. Now I have coal which I can use to smelt my raw iron and raw copper if needed, though neither are needed for the shovel.  My opponent traded for raw iron, likely to make a bucket, which requires iron ingots.
- I should craft sticks from my oak planks, then craft the stone_shovel.  <current status>
- I have enough materials to craft the stone shovel.
- I will check what I can craft. Then I will craft sticks and then the shovel.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket. I need 3 iron ingots to craft it. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 1 raw iron. I traded away one of my raw iron for coal in the last turn. My opponent has 5 raw iron. If I get 2 raw iron from them in the next turn, I can smelt my 3 raw iron into 3 iron ingots and craft the bucket. I should propose this trade in the next turn.  They said their target is a stone_shovel, which requires cobblestone, sticks (made from planks). They have both, so they should be able to craft it now.
- I will ask for 2 raw iron in the next turn's proposing phase. Then I will smelt the raw iron into iron ingots and then craft the bucket.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I need cobblestone and sticks. I have 1 cobblestone.  Sticks are crafted from planks. I have 1 oak_planks. I need 2 oak planks to make sticks. I traded some raw_iron for coal in the last turn. Now I have coal which I can use to smelt my raw iron and raw copper if needed, though neither are needed for the shovel.  My opponent traded for raw iron, likely to make a bucket, which requires iron ingots. He has enough raw iron now.
- I don't have enough oak planks to make sticks. I need to ask my opponent if they can give me one.  Since they want to make a bucket, they probably don't need their cherry planks.  <current status>
- I will ask my opponent for a cherry plank. If they agree, I can craft the shovel.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I need a stone shovel.  A stone shovel requires cobblestone and sticks. I have cobblestone, but I need sticks. Sticks are crafted from planks. I have oak planks, so I can make sticks and then a shovel. I should tell my opponent my target and see if they need anything.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- player 1 is offering nothing and requesting nothing. They are asking about my target item.  Since we are supposed to be cooperating, I should tell them. I also need to figure out how to make a bucket.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **bucket**.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- I need 3 iron ingots to make a bucket. I only have one.  I should ask if they can give me some iron.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2 decided to Accept the proposal with a text message: My target is a bucket.  Could you trade me some iron ingots?


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I need cobblestone and sticks. I have cobblestone, but I need sticks. Sticks are crafted from planks, and I have oak_planks.  My opponent's target is a bucket, which requires iron_ingots. I have raw_iron and coal, which can be smelted into iron_ingots.  My opponent has iron_ingot already, and needs more raw_iron. I can trade my raw_iron for their iron_ingot, which will help both of us.
- I need to confirm the recipe for sticks.  <current status>
- I can craft sticks from my oak_planks. Then I can craft the stone_shovel. I should offer some raw_iron to my opponent for their iron_ingot. This will help them get closer to their bucket, and I can save some coal.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket. I need 3 iron ingots. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron. My opponent has 3 raw iron.  I need to smelt my raw iron and acquire 1 more iron ingot from my opponent.  They stated their target is a stone_shovel, which requires 1 cobblestone and 2 sticks. They have the cobblestone, and could make sticks from their oak planks. It seems they can complete their target this turn. I should help them if I can, while also working towards my own goal.
- I need to confirm how to craft iron ingots. I also want to see if there are any other ways to get iron ingots, although I think smelting raw iron is the most straightforward method.
- I need to confirm the recipe for a bucket. I believe it's 3 iron ingots.  <current status>
- I will propose a trade with my opponent. I will offer them 1 raw iron. I will request 1 raw iron from them. This will allow both of us to have enough iron to craft our target items.

I can trade my raw_iron for their iron_ingot, which will help both of us. I previously offered 2 raw_iron for 1 coal, which was rejected. This time I'll offer 1 raw_iron for 1 iron_ingot.
- I need to confirm the recipe for sticks and stone_shovel to make sure I have the correct amounts.  <current status>
- I can craft sticks from my oak_planks. Then I can craft the stone_shovel. I should offer some raw_iron to my opponent for their iron_ingot. This will help them get closer to their bucket, and I can save some coal.  I will offer 1 raw_iron for 1 iron_ingot.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:

It seems they can complete their target this turn. I should help them if I can, while also working towards my own goal.  Since they only need 2 sticks (crafted from 2 planks, which they have), they will have 2 raw iron left over after making their shovel. I should ask for those 2.

- One raw iron smelts into one iron ingot, using one coal as fuel.  Two oak planks make 4 sticks.  A stone shovel requires 2 sticks and 1 cobblestone. I have enough oak planks and cobblestone.  If the trade goes through, I'll have enough materials to craft the stone shovel. If not, I can smelt one raw iron into an iron ingot, and craft an iron shovel instead.

- I need to confirm the recipe for a bucket. I believe it's 3 iron ingots.  <current status>
- I will propose a trade with my opponent. I will offer them nothing. I will request 2 raw iron and 0.5 coal from them. This will allow me to have enough iron and fuel to craft my target item.  They should have enough raw iron and coal left over after crafting their shovel.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__possible_recipes_from_hand`
player 2 is checking the posssible recipes from his/her hand crafts.


### üñ• Server Event: `server__possible_recipes_from_hand`
Server shows the possible recipes of player 2 with his/her current hand crafts are: 
   - iron nugget
   - cobblestone slab from cobblestone stonecutting
   - cobblestone wall from cobblestone stonecutting
   - cobblestone stairs from cobblestone stonecutting
   - cherry button
   - iron ingot from smelting raw iron
   - iron ingot from blasting raw iron
   - copper ingot from smelting raw copper
   - copper ingot from blasting raw copper
   - stone


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I need cobblestone and sticks. I have cobblestone, but I need sticks. Sticks are crafted from planks, and I have oak_planks.  My opponent's target is a bucket, which requires iron_ingots. I have raw_iron and coal, which can be smelted into iron_ingots. My opponent has one iron_ingot and needs more. I can trade my raw_iron for their iron_ingot, which will help both of us. I previously offered 2 raw_iron for 1 coal, which was rejected. This time I'll offer 1 raw_iron for 1 iron_ingot.  I need to be sure I have enough sticks for the shovel.  I should also check if my coal is enough to smelt the raw iron if the trade fails. I have enough coal to smelt all my raw iron if needed.
- One raw iron smelts into one iron ingot, using one coal/charcoal/bucket of lava as fuel.  Two oak planks make 4 sticks.  A stone shovel requires 2 sticks and 1 cobblestone. I have enough oak planks and cobblestone.  If the trade goes through, I'll have enough materials to craft the stone shovel. If not, I can smelt one raw iron into an iron ingot, and craft an iron shovel instead.  Since my target is a stone shovel, I should prioritize getting the iron ingot through trade.
