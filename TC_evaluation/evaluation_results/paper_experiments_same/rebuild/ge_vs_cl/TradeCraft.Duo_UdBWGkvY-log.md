### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- I need to craft shears as my target item. Let me first check the recipe for shears to understand what ingredients I need.
- I see that to craft shears, I need 2 iron ingots. Currently, I have: - 1 iron ingot - 1 cherry planks - 1 coal - 1 cobblestone - 1 raw copper  My opponent (player 1) has: - 1 cobblestone - 1 oak planks - 2 raw copper - 5 raw iron  I need one more iron ingot to craft shears. I can get this by trading for raw iron and then smelting it. Let me check the recipe for iron ingot.

### üñ• Server Event: `server__proposal_invalid`
player 2's proposal is INVALID according to the game rule.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- I need to craft shears, which requires iron ingots. Let me first check the recipe for shears to understand what I need.
- I see that shears require 2 iron ingots to craft. Looking at my current hand: - I already have 1 iron ingot - I need 1 more iron ingot  My opponent (player 1) has 5 raw_iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots. I should try to trade for some raw_iron.  Let me check how to convert raw_iron to iron_ingot:

- Perfect! I can see that 1 raw_iron can be smelted into 1 iron_ingot. Since I need 1 more iron_ingot to craft shears, I should trade for 1 raw_iron from player 1.  Now I need to decide what to offer in exchange. Looking at my current items: - minecraft:cherry_planks: 1 - minecraft:coal: 1 - minecraft:cobblestone: 1 - minecraft:iron_ingot: 1 - minecraft:raw_copper: 1  I could offer my raw_copper since player 1 already has some raw_copper, and they might want more. I could also offer coal which would be useful for smelting.  Let me craft a proposal where I offer my coal in exchange for 1 raw_iron. This seems fair since coal is needed for smelting and player 1 has plenty of raw_iron (5).
- My proposal looks good now.

### üñ• Server Event: `server__proposal_invalid`
player 2's proposal is INVALID according to the game rule.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- First, I need to understand what items are needed to craft shears. Let me check the recipe for shears.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **shears**.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- I see that to craft shears, I need 2 iron ingots. Looking at my current hand, I already have 1 iron ingot, so I need 1 more iron ingot. My opponent has 5 raw_iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots.  Let me check the recipe for turning raw_iron into iron_ingot.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **iron_ingot**.


### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **stick**.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- To craft shears, I need 2 iron ingots. I already have 1 iron ingot in my hand, so I need 1 more. My opponent (player 1) has 5 raw_iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots. I also have cherry_planks which I can use to craft sticks, and I have coal which can be used as fuel for smelting.  Looking at what I can offer: - I have 1 coal (which is valuable as fuel) - I have 1 raw_copper (which player 1 already has 2 of) - I have 1 cherry_planks (which I could use to craft sticks)  Looking at what I need: - I need 1 more iron ingot OR some raw_iron to smelt  Since player 1 has 5 raw_iron, I should request some of that. I'll offer my coal (which is useful as fuel for smelting) and request 2 raw_iron in return. This is a fair trade since they'll need fuel to smelt their own raw_iron, and I'm only asking for a portion of their raw_iron.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:coal * 1, ] together with a text message: I'm offering coal which you can use as fuel for smelting. In exchange, I'd like 2 raw_iron. This is a fair trade since you'll still have 3 raw_iron left, and the coal will help you smelt those efficiently. This trade benefits both of us as we can each craft valuable items with these resources.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a torch.  A torch requires a stick and coal. I have no coal currently.  This trade offers me coal in exchange for two raw iron. I have plenty of raw iron. This trade seems beneficial to me.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Sounds good. Thanks!
