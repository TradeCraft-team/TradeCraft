## 🌀 Turn 1 start!
----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My team's target is to craft 1 bucket. Let me first check the recipe for a bucket to understand what ingredients we need.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **bucket**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I see that to craft a bucket, we need 3 iron ingots. Currently, I have 1 iron ingot in my hand, but I need 2 more. My opponent has 5 raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots.  Let me check the recipe for turning raw iron into iron ingots.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **iron_ingot**.

player 2 checked the item info of craft: **bucket**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My team's target is to craft 1 bucket. I see that to craft a bucket, we need 3 iron ingots. Currently, I have 1 iron ingot in my hand, but I need 2 more. My opponent has 5 raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots.  From the recipe information, I can see that to convert raw iron into iron ingots, I need: - 1 raw iron - 1/8 of fuel (coal works as fuel)  I currently have: - 1 iron ingot - 1 coal (which can be used as fuel) - 1 raw copper - 1 cherry planks - 1 cobblestone  My opponent has: - 5 raw iron (which I need) - 2 raw copper - 1 oak planks - 1 cobblestone  I should propose a trade where I request some raw iron from my opponent. I have coal which can be used as fuel to smelt the raw iron into iron ingots. I could offer my raw copper since my opponent already has some, which might be useful for them.  Let me craft a proposal that would be beneficial for both of us:

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:raw_copper * 1, ] together with a text message: I notice you have 5 raw iron, and I need 2 more to craft my target item. I'm offering my raw copper which would give you 3 in total - enough for a complete set. This trade helps us both progress toward our goals. I already have the coal needed to smelt the raw iron, so this is the missing piece I need.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a lever.  A lever requires a cobblestone and a stick. I already have the cobblestone.  A stick can be crafted from planks, and I already have oak planks. Therefore, I don't need more raw copper.  Trading away raw iron might hinder player 2's progress, which could be beneficial to me.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1 decided to reject the proposal with a text message: I don't need any more raw copper at the moment. Good luck!


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a lever.  I need a stick and a cobblestone. I have the cobblestone, but I need a stick.  Sticks are crafted from planks, and I have one oak plank. This is enough to make the lever. Player 2 offered a raw copper for 2 of my raw iron. I don't need raw copper, and while I could smelt the raw iron into ingots, I don't need iron ingots for my target.  I should focus on crafting the lever.  <current status>
- I have everything I need to craft the lever. I'll craft sticks from the oak plank, then craft the lever using the stick and cobblestone.
- Confirming the stick recipe.
- Confirming the lever recipe.

- Confirming the stick recipe.
- Confirmed both recipes. Ready to craft.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:

## 🌀 Turn 2 start!
----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I need to figure out how to craft a lever.  I know my current hand contains cobblestone, oak planks, raw copper, and raw iron. Let's check the recipe for a lever.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **lever**.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- Okay, I need cobblestone and a stick. I already have cobblestone. Now I need to figure out how to make a stick.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **stick**.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I can craft sticks from planks. I have oak planks.  Player 2 has cherry planks, but I don't need to trade for them. I can make the sticks myself. Since I have all the ingredients for a lever, I don't need to trade.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [], offer [] together with a text message: I have everything I need. Thanks!


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I need to analyze this proposal and decide whether to accept or reject it. The proposal is essentially empty - player 1 is not offering anything and not requesting anything. They also sent a message saying "I have everything I need. Thanks!"  Let me first check what I need to craft my target item, which is a bucket.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **bucket**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I see that to craft a bucket, I need 3 iron ingots. Currently, I only have 1 iron ingot in my hand. I need 2 more iron ingots to craft my target item.  Looking at the proposal from player 1, they're not offering anything and not requesting anything. It's an empty trade. They also mentioned they have everything they need.  Looking at player 1's hand, I notice they have 5 raw iron. If I could get some of that raw iron and smelt it into iron ingots, I could craft my bucket. However, this empty proposal doesn't help me progress toward my goal.  Since this proposal doesn't involve any actual exchange of items, accepting or rejecting it won't make any difference to my inventory. However, I should probably reject it to signal that I'm interested in actual trades that could help me get more iron.  I'll reject this proposal and send a message indicating what I'm looking for.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2 decided to reject the proposal with a text message: I'm looking to acquire more iron to complete my crafting goals. Would you be willing to trade some of your raw iron in a future turn?


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:

## 🌀 Turn 3 start!
----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I need to craft a bucket, which requires 3 iron ingots. Currently I have only 1 iron ingot, so I need 2 more. My opponent has 5 raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots. I should try to trade for some of their raw iron.  Let me first check the recipe for a bucket to confirm what I need.
- As I confirmed, I need 3 iron ingots to craft a bucket. I currently have 1 iron ingot, so I need 2 more. My opponent has 5 raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots.  Let me check the recipe for iron ingot to confirm how raw iron is converted.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I need to craft a bucket, which requires 3 iron ingots. Currently I have only 1 iron ingot, so I need 2 more. My opponent has 5 raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots. I should try to trade for some of their raw iron.  Let me first check the recipe for a bucket to confirm what I need.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I need to craft a bucket, which requires 3 iron ingots according to the recipe. Currently I have only 1 iron ingot, so I need 2 more. Looking at my opponent's inventory, they have 5 raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots. I should try to trade for some of their raw iron.  From the recipe information, I can see that 1 raw iron + 1/8 coal = 1 iron ingot. I need 2 more iron ingots, so I need 2 raw iron. I should offer something valuable to my opponent in exchange.  Looking at what I have: - minecraft:cherry_planks: 1 - minecraft:copper_ingot: 1 - minecraft:iron_ingot: 1 - minecraft:stone: 1  And what my opponent has: - minecraft:cobblestone: 1 - minecraft:oak_planks: 1 - minecraft:raw_copper: 2 - minecraft:raw_iron: 5  I could offer my copper_ingot since they have raw_copper, which suggests they might be interested in copper items. This seems like a fair trade - a processed copper ingot for some of their raw iron.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:copper_ingot * 1, ] together with a text message: I notice you have raw iron, and I have a copper ingot already processed and ready to use. This saves you the smelting step for your copper. Would you be willing to trade 2 of your raw iron for my copper ingot? This would be beneficial for both of us as we can each progress toward our crafting goals.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a lever, which requires a stick and cobblestone. I already have the cobblestone.  Sticks can be crafted from planks, and I already have oak planks.  Therefore, I don't need the copper ingot.  Trading away raw iron would be detrimental as it could be useful for other crafting recipes if my initial plan fails.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1 decided to reject the proposal with a text message: I don't need copper right now.  Thanks for the offer though.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- First, I need to understand what a bucket requires to craft and check if we have the necessary materials or need to trade for them. Let me check the recipe for a bucket.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a lever.  Player 2 has tried to trade for my raw iron twice now, suggesting their target might require it.  I have plenty of raw iron, but I need a stick.  I have oak planks, which can be crafted into sticks.  I should craft a stick and then see if I can trade for more cobblestone to make the lever.  <current status>
- I will craft a stick using my oak planks.
- Assuming the `possible_recipes_from_hand` confirms I can craft sticks, I'll proceed with that.
- Now I need to figure out how to get cobblestone. I already have one.  I could try trading with Player 2 again, offering some raw iron for their stone.

- My target is a lever. Player 2 has repeatedly tried to trade for my raw iron, strongly suggesting their target needs it. I have plenty of raw iron, but I need a stick and another cobblestone. I have oak planks, which can be crafted into sticks. I should craft a stick and then propose a trade with Player 2 for their stone.  <current status>
- I'm checking if I can craft sticks with my current resources.
- Confirming the stick recipe.  I'll need 2 planks for 4 sticks, but I only have one plank. I'll get 2 sticks.
- Confirming the lever recipe. I need one stick and one cobblestone.
- I have enough raw iron to offer Player 2 a good trade for their stone.  Since they seem keen on iron, I'll offer a generous amount.

Since Player 2 has already rejected a 2 raw iron for 1 raw copper trade, and a 2 raw iron for 1 copper ingot trade, I will offer a more generous trade of 3 raw iron for their stone.  <current status>

Since Player 2 has already rejected a 2 raw iron for 1 raw copper trade, and a 2 raw iron for 1 copper ingot trade, I will offer a more generous trade of 3 raw iron for their stone.  <current status>

## 🌀 Turn 4 start!
----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I need a cobblestone and a stick to craft a lever. I already have a cobblestone.  A stick can be crafted from planks. I have oak planks, so I can make a stick and then the lever. I don't need to trade.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **lever**.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I have everything I need to craft a lever. I should make a proposal offering something I don't need in exchange for something that might be useful later, or simply decline to trade. Since Player 2 has expressed interest in iron, I'll offer some raw copper.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:iron_ingot * 1, ], offer [minecraft:raw_copper * 1, ] together with a text message: I have enough materials to craft my target item.  I'm offering some raw copper. Would you trade an iron ingot for it?


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I need to evaluate this trade proposal carefully. My team's target item is a bucket. Let me first check what's needed to craft a bucket.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **bucket**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I see that to craft a bucket, I need 3 iron ingots. Currently, I only have 1 iron ingot, so I need 2 more.  Player 1 is offering to trade me 1 raw_copper in exchange for my 1 iron_ingot. This would be a bad trade for me since: 1. I need iron ingots to craft my target item (bucket) 2. I already have a copper ingot, and raw copper would be a downgrade 3. Trading away my only iron ingot would set me back significantly from my goal  Let me check what raw_copper can be used for, just to be thorough:

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **raw_copper**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- Looking at the information, I can see that raw_copper can be smelted into copper_ingot using fuel, but I already have a copper_ingot in my inventory. More importantly, I need iron_ingots to craft my target item (a bucket), which requires 3 iron_ingots.  Currently I only have 1 iron_ingot, and if I trade it away, I'll have zero progress toward my target item. This would be a very poor trade for me since:  1. I need 3 iron_ingots to craft a bucket (my target) 2. I already have a copper_ingot, so getting raw_copper doesn't help me 3. Player 1 mentioned they have enough materials to craft their target item, so this trade primarily benefits them  I should reject this proposal and keep my iron_ingot. I need to either get more iron_ingots through trades or find a way to craft them from other materials.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2 decided to reject the proposal with a text message: I need to keep my iron ingot as it's essential for crafting my target item. I already have a copper ingot, so raw copper isn't helpful for me right now. Good luck with your crafting!

Currently, I only have 1 iron ingot in my hand, so I need 2 more iron ingots to craft my target.  My opponent has 5 raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots. Each raw iron can be smelted into 1 iron ingot using a furnace with fuel. I need to trade with my opponent to get at least 2 raw iron.  For fuel, I could potentially use my cherry planks, as wooden planks can serve as fuel in a furnace. I also need to check if I can craft a furnace with my current materials.

## 🌀 Turn 6 start!
----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I need a cobblestone and a stick to craft a lever. I already have a cobblestone.  A stick can be crafted from planks, and I have oak planks.  Therefore, I don't need to trade.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **lever**.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I have enough materials to craft a lever myself. I don't need to trade.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [], offer [] together with a text message: I don't need anything from you this turn. Good luck!


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- Let me analyze this proposal. Player 1 is not actually proposing any trade - they're just sending a message saying they don't need anything from me this turn. This is essentially a "null" proposal where no items would be exchanged.  My team's target item is a bucket. Let me check what's needed to craft a bucket.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **bucket**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I see that to craft a bucket, I need 3 iron ingots. Currently, I only have 1 iron ingot, so I need 2 more to craft my target item.  Looking at my current hand: - 1 copper_ingot - 1 iron_ingot - 1 smooth_stone  And my opponent's hand: - 1 cobblestone - 1 oak_planks - 2 raw_copper - 5 raw_iron  The opponent has 5 raw_iron, which could be smelted into iron ingots. That's what I need for my bucket. However, in this proposal, they're not offering anything or requesting anything - it's just a message saying they don't need anything from me this turn.  Since there's no actual trade being proposed (no items being exchanged), there's no reason to reject it. Accepting a null proposal doesn't change anything in our hands. However, I should use this opportunity to communicate my needs to them.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2 decided to ACCEPT the proposal with a text message: I notice you have raw_iron and I need iron ingots to craft my target. Would you be willing to trade some raw_iron in a future turn? I could offer copper_ingot or smooth_stone.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- First, I need to understand what items we have and what we need to craft a bucket. Let me check the recipe for a bucket.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a lever.  Player 2 has consistently rejected my trade proposals and seems focused on acquiring iron.  I have plenty of raw iron, but they haven't offered anything I particularly need.  I have cobblestone, oak planks, raw copper, and raw iron. I need to figure out how to craft a lever with what I have or what I can realistically get from Player 2.
- Let's see the recipe for a lever.  I need to check if I have the necessary components or if I can craft them from my current resources.  <current status>
- Assuming the lever recipe requires a stick and cobblestone (which it does, confirmed by the item_info action above), I already have the cobblestone. I need to craft a stick.  Sticks require planks, and I have oak planks.  I should be able to craft the lever this turn without needing to trade.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a lever. Player 2 has consistently rejected my trade proposals, prioritizing iron acquisition.  I have cobblestone, oak planks, raw copper, and raw iron. I need to craft a lever.  I should have everything I need already.
- The lever recipe requires a stick and cobblestone. I have the cobblestone.  I need to craft a stick from my oak planks.

- My target is a lever. Player 2 has consistently rejected my trade proposals and seems focused on acquiring iron.  I have cobblestone, oak planks, raw copper, and raw iron. I need to craft a lever.  I should have everything I need already.
- The lever recipe requires a stick and cobblestone. I have the cobblestone.  I need to craft a stick from my oak planks.  Since I only need one stick, I'll use the fractional recipe for sticks.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a lever. Player 2 has consistently rejected my trade proposals and seems focused on acquiring iron.  I have cobblestone, oak planks, raw copper, and raw iron. I need to craft a lever.  I should have everything I need already.
- The lever recipe requires a stick and cobblestone. I have the cobblestone.  I need to craft a stick from my oak planks.  I'll craft 4 sticks (using 2 planks) since fractional crafting isn't allowed, and I'll have extra sticks for potential future crafts.

Looking at player 1's inventory, they have 5 raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots. I should try to trade for some raw iron.  Let me check how to convert raw iron to iron ingot to confirm the recipe.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- Perfect! I can see that 1 raw iron can be smelted into 1 iron ingot. Since I need 2 more iron ingots to craft my bucket (I already have 1), I need to get 2 raw iron from player 1.  Looking at player 1's inventory: - 1 cobblestone - 1 oak planks - 2 raw copper - 5 raw iron  They have plenty of raw iron (5), so I should propose a trade for 2 of their raw iron. What can I offer in return? I have: - 1 copper ingot - 1 iron ingot - 1 smooth stone  I should offer something that might be valuable to them but that I don't need for my bucket. The copper ingot or smooth stone would be good options. Since I've tried offering copper and stone in previous turns and they were rejected, I should try a different approach.  Let me offer my smooth stone for 2 raw iron. I'll craft a message that emphasizes the value of smooth stone and how it might help them with their crafting goals.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:smooth_stone * 1, ] together with a text message: I notice you have plenty of raw iron. I'm offering smooth stone which is a processed material that saves you time and fuel from having to smelt stone twice. This could be useful for various building projects or crafting. Would you be willing to trade 2 raw iron for my smooth stone? This would be mutually beneficial as we both get materials we need.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a lever.  A lever requires a stick and cobblestone. I already have cobblestone.  Sticks can be crafted from planks, and I already have oak planks. I don't need smooth stone.  Trading away raw iron might hinder me if I need it for something else later, although right now it doesn't seem useful.  Since I don't need the smooth stone, I should reject the offer.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1 decided to reject the proposal with a text message: I don't need smooth stone right now. Thanks for the offer though.

- I need a cobblestone and a stick to craft a lever. I already have a cobblestone.  To make a stick, I need planks. I have oak planks, which work.  So I can craft a stick and then the lever without trading.  However, trading might be faster if I can get a stick directly.  Since player 2 has not accepted any of my previous proposals, I will try a different approach and offer something for a stick, even though I don't strictly need to trade.

From the item_info, I can see that raw_iron can be smelted into iron_ingot at a 1:1 ratio (with some fuel). So if I accept this trade, I'll have: - 0 iron_ingot (giving away my only one) - 2 raw_iron (received from trade)  With fuel, I could convert those 2 raw_iron into 2 iron_ingot. But that would leave me with 2 iron_ingot total, which is still short of the 3 I need for a bucket.  If I reject the trade, I keep my 1 iron_ingot, but I'm still far from my goal of 3.  Let me check if I have any fuel to smelt raw_iron:

I don't see any obvious fuel in my current inventory, but I might be able to craft or obtain some in future turns. The trade seems to be offering me a net gain of 1 iron (trading 1 iron_ingot for 2 raw_iron which can become 2 iron_ingots), which would help me get closer to my bucket goal.  This trade actually makes sense for me since I need more iron to craft a bucket. Even though I'll temporarily lose my only iron_ingot, I'll end up with the potential for 2 iron_ingots after smelting, which is a net gain.

Looking at my opponent's inventory, I see they have 1 iron ingot and 3 raw iron.  I also need fuel to smelt my raw iron. Looking at the fuel options, I see that coal would be efficient (1/8 coal per raw iron), but I don't have any coal. I do have a copper ingot that I could potentially trade.  My opponent has 1 iron ingot which would be perfect for me. They also have raw copper, which suggests they might be working with copper. I could offer my copper ingot in exchange for their iron ingot.  Let me craft a proposal that would be mutually beneficial. I'll offer my copper ingot for their iron ingot.

- My target is a lever, which requires a stick and cobblestone. I already have the cobblestone.  A stick can be crafted from planks, and I already have oak planks.  Therefore, I don't need the iron ingot or the copper ingot.  However, accepting the trade could be beneficial if player 2 needs the iron ingot for their target item. It might make them more willing to trade for something I need in the future.  Rejecting the trade won't hurt me, but it might make player 2 less willing to trade with me later.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I need to craft a bucket, which requires 3 iron ingots. Currently I have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron. I need to smelt the raw iron to get more iron ingots, and I might need to trade for more iron. Let me check the recipe for a bucket to confirm.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **bucket**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- As I suspected, a bucket requires 3 iron ingots. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron. I can smelt the raw iron to get 2 more iron ingots, which would give me the 3 iron ingots I need for a bucket. However, I should check if I need any fuel for smelting.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **raw_iron**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I need to craft a bucket which requires 3 iron ingots. Currently I have: - 1 iron ingot - 2 raw iron - 2 smooth stone slabs  I need to smelt my 2 raw iron into 2 more iron ingots, but I need fuel for that. Looking at the recipe information, I need 1/8 unit of fuel per raw iron. I don't have any fuel items in my inventory.  Looking at my opponent's inventory, they have: - 1 cobblestone - 1 copper ingot - 1 oak planks (which can be used as fuel) - 2 raw copper - 3 raw iron  I should try to trade for some fuel so I can smelt my raw iron. According to the recipe information, oak planks can be used as fuel (2/3 units), which would be more than enough to smelt my 2 raw iron (which needs 2 × 1/8 = 1/4 units of fuel).  I'll propose a trade where I offer one of my smooth stone slabs in exchange for their oak planks. This seems fair since both are processed building materials, and I need the oak planks as fuel while they might find the smooth stone slabs useful for building.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a lever, which requires a stick and cobblestone. I already have the cobblestone.  Sticks can be crafted from planks.  While a smooth stone slab isn't directly useful for my target, accepting the trade would give player 2 fuel, potentially allowing them to craft more iron ingots. More iron ingots in their hand might make them more willing to trade for my raw iron later, which I could use to craft more iron ingots myself (though I don't need them for the lever). I could also use the planks to make sticks right now.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- Player 2 has been trying to get raw iron from me and has offered smooth stone slabs and a copper ingot in return.  They mentioned needing iron ingots for their target (possibly a bucket). I need a stick for a lever, and cobblestone can be smelted into stone.  I could offer raw iron for their iron ingot, since they seem to need more iron.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **lever**.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I could use planks to make sticks, which I already have.  Since Player 2 needs iron, I can offer some raw iron for their iron ingot, even though I already have one. This would give me a backup in case I lose my current iron ingot somehow.  It also helps Player 2 get closer to their goal, which might make them more willing to trade with me in the future.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I see that a bucket requires 3 iron ingots to craft. Currently, I have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron. If I accept this trade, I'll have 0 iron ingots and 4 raw iron.  Let me check how raw iron can be converted to iron ingots.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **iron_ingot**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I need to carefully evaluate this trade offer from player 1. My target item is a bucket, which requires 3 iron ingots to craft. Currently, I have: - 1 iron ingot - 2 raw iron - 2 smooth stone slabs  If I accept this trade, I'll have: - 0 iron ingots - 4 raw iron - 2 smooth stone slabs  From the recipe information, I can see that 1 raw iron + fuel can be smelted into 1 iron ingot. So with 4 raw iron, I could potentially craft 4 iron ingots, which is more than the 3 I need for a bucket.  However, I need to consider if I have the necessary fuel to smelt the raw iron. Looking at the fuel options, I would need some type of fuel like coal, wood planks, or sticks. I don't currently have any of these in my inventory.  This is a tricky decision. On one hand, getting more raw iron gets me closer to having enough material for a bucket. On the other hand, without the iron ingot I currently have, I'd need to find fuel to smelt all 4 raw iron.  Let me check if there's any way to craft fuel from my current items.

Currently, I have: - 1 iron ingot - 2 raw iron - 2 smooth stone slabs  If I accept this trade, I'll have: - 0 iron ingots - 4 raw iron - 2 smooth stone slabs  From the recipe information, I can see that 1 raw iron + fuel can be smelted into 1 iron ingot. So with 4 raw iron, I could potentially craft 4 iron ingots, which is more than the 3 I need for a bucket.  However, I need to consider if I have the necessary fuel to smelt the raw iron. Looking at the fuel options, I would need some type of fuel like coal, wood planks, or sticks. I don't currently have any of these in my inventory, and my smooth stone slabs can't be used as fuel.  This trade would leave me with no immediate iron ingots, and I'd need to find fuel to smelt the raw iron. Since I already have 1 iron ingot, I only need 2 more to craft a bucket. With my current 2 raw iron, if I can find fuel, I could make those 2 additional iron ingots.  Trading away my only iron ingot puts me in a position where I'd need to smelt all 4 raw iron, requiring more fuel. While I'd end up with potentially 4 iron ingots (more than needed), I'd be starting from zero ingots and would be completely dependent on finding fuel.  I think it's better to keep my current iron ingot as a guaranteed component for my bucket, and focus on finding fuel to smelt my existing raw iron. This way I'm already 1/3 of the way to my goal rather than starting over.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2 decided to reject the proposal with a text message: Thank you for the offer, but I need to keep my iron ingot as I'm working toward crafting a bucket. I already have some raw iron to smelt, and keeping this ingot puts me closer to my goal.
