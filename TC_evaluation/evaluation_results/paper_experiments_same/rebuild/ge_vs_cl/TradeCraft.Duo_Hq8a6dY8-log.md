player 2 enters the game with a private target: [minecraft:stone_shovel * 1, ]



## 🌀 Turn 1 start!
----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I need to craft a bucket.  Buckets are made of iron ingots. I have one iron ingot. I need two more. My opponent has a lot of raw iron. I should try to trade for some raw iron, then smelt it into iron ingots.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **bucket**.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I need two more iron ingots.  It takes one raw iron to make one iron ingot.  My opponent has five raw iron. I will offer them my coal and cobblestone for two raw iron.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:coal * 1, minecraft:cobblestone * 1, ] together with a text message: I need two raw iron to make a bucket. I'll give you my coal and cobblestone for two of your raw iron.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I need to evaluate this trade based on my goal of crafting a stone shovel. Let me first check what's needed to craft a stone shovel.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **stone_shovel**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I see that to craft a stone shovel, I need: 1. 2 sticks 2. 1 cobblestone (which falls under #stone_tool_materials)  Let me check what I need to craft sticks.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **stick**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- Looking at what I need for a stone shovel: 1. 2 sticks - which can be crafted from 2 planks (and I already have oak_planks) 2. 1 cobblestone  Currently I have: - 1 cobblestone - 1 oak_planks - 2 raw_copper - 5 raw_iron  The trade would give me: - +1 cobblestone (giving me 2 total) - +1 coal But I would lose 2 raw_iron (leaving me with 3)  This is actually a good trade for me because: 1. I need cobblestone to craft my stone shovel, and getting a second one gives me flexibility 2. Coal could be useful for smelting if needed 3. I still have 3 raw_iron left after the trade, which is plenty since I don't need iron for my target item  The opponent wants to make a bucket which requires iron, so this trade makes sense for both of us. I don't need all 5 of my raw_iron to achieve my goal.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: I'll trade my 2 raw iron for your coal and cobblestone. This works well for me as I can use the extra cobblestone. Good luck with your bucket!


### 🖥 Server Event: `server__update_all_hands`

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket.  A bucket requires 3 iron ingots. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron. Player 2 has 3 raw iron. I traded for 2 raw iron from Player 2 last turn. I now have enough raw iron to make 3 iron ingots, and therefore a bucket.
- I need to smelt the raw iron into iron ingots. I need fuel for this. I traded my coal and cobblestone for raw iron last turn.  I need to trade for coal again. Player 2 has coal.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- First, I need to understand what a stone shovel requires and check if I have the necessary ingredients or can craft them.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket. A bucket requires 3 iron ingots. I have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron. I just traded with Player 2 to get 2 more raw iron. Now I have a total of 3 raw iron.  I need to smelt them into ingots.  This requires a furnace and fuel. I traded away my coal last turn.  I need to get more fuel. I have cherry planks which can be used as fuel, but they are inefficient. Player 2 has coal. I should try to trade for it.
- Confirmed - 3 iron ingots are needed for a bucket.
- I can smelt raw iron into iron ingots.  This requires fuel.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

player 2's proposal is INVALID according to the game rule.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I need to make a proposal to help us craft a stone shovel. Let me first check what's needed to craft a stone shovel.
- To craft a stone shovel, I need: - 2 sticks - 3 stone  Looking at our current hand: - minecraft:oak_planks: 1 - minecraft:raw_copper: 2 - minecraft:raw_iron: 3 - minecraft:stone: 2  We already have 2 stone, but we need 1 more stone and 2 sticks. Let me check how to craft sticks from oak planks.

- To craft a stone shovel, I need: - 2 sticks - 3 stone  Looking at our current hand: - minecraft:oak_planks: 1 - minecraft:raw_copper: 2 - minecraft:raw_iron: 3 - minecraft:stone: 2  We already have 2 stone, but we need 1 more stone and 2 sticks. Let me check how to craft sticks from oak planks.
- I see that I need 2 oak planks to craft 4 sticks. We only have 1 oak plank, so we need 1 more oak plank or we need to get sticks directly. Let me also check how to get more stone.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I see that stone can be crafted from cobblestone. We currently have: - 2 stone (need 1 more for the shovel) - 0 sticks (need 2 for the shovel) - 1 oak plank (need 1 more to craft sticks)  Looking at our opponent's hand: - minecraft:cherry_planks: 1 - minecraft:iron_ingot: 1 - minecraft:raw_copper: 1 - minecraft:raw_iron: 2  I notice that our opponent has cherry planks, which can also be used to craft sticks. Let me check if there's anything else we might need.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- To craft a stone shovel, I need: - 2 sticks - 3 stone  Currently I have: - 2 stone (need 1 more) - 1 oak plank (can be used to make sticks, but need more)  Looking at my opponent's inventory, they have cherry planks which could be useful for making sticks. I also need one more stone, which can be crafted from cobblestone.  For my proposal, I should try to get either: 1. More planks (oak or cherry) to craft sticks, and cobblestone to craft into stone 2. Direct sticks and stone/cobblestone  Let me make a proposal to player 1 that helps me get closer to crafting a stone shovel.
- Looking at our current hands:  My hand: - minecraft:oak_planks: 1 - minecraft:raw_copper: 2 - minecraft:raw_iron: 3 - minecraft:stone: 2  Player 1's hand: - minecraft:cherry_planks: 1 - minecraft:iron_ingot: 1 - minecraft:raw_copper: 1 - minecraft:raw_iron: 2  To craft a stone shovel, I need 3 stone and 2 sticks. I already have 2 stone, so I need 1 more stone and 2 sticks.  I could propose trading some of my raw materials (raw_copper or raw_iron) for player 1's cherry_planks (to make sticks) and possibly for cobblestone (which I can smelt into stone).  However, I don't see cobblestone in player 1's hand. I need to consider what would be valuable to them while helping me get closer to my goal.  Since player 1 has iron_ingot and raw_iron, they might be working toward iron tools or other iron items. I could offer some of my raw_iron in exchange for their cherry_planks.  Let me make a proposal that's beneficial for both of us.

I'm offering raw copper which you might find useful for your future crafting projects. This trade would help us both progress toward our goals.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a bucket.  Buckets are made of iron ingots. I already have one iron ingot and two raw iron.  Three raw iron can be smelted into three iron ingots.  I don't need more raw copper. Cherry planks are useless to me for making a bucket.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket. I need 3 iron ingots to craft it. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron.  Player 2 has 3 raw iron. I need to get 1 more raw iron from Player 2 to be able to craft 3 iron ingots. I also have 2 raw copper.
- I confirmed the recipe for bucket. Now I need to figure out how to get the raw iron from Player 2.  He has oak planks and stone, which I don't need.  I have 2 raw copper which he might want.
- I'll offer 1 raw copper for 1 raw iron.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

- Confirmed the recipe for iron ingot: smelting raw iron.  I need fuel for that. I don't have any fuel.  I need to consider getting fuel as well.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I need more iron ingots to craft a bucket.  I have 2 raw iron and 1 iron ingot, which is not enough. My opponent has 3 raw iron. I could try to trade for some of their raw iron. I also have 2 raw copper which I don't need for the bucket, so I can offer that in exchange.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **bucket**.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I need 3 iron ingots total, and I currently have 1. I need 2 more iron ingots.  It takes 1 raw iron to make an iron ingot, but since I only have 2 raw iron, I'll need to trade for at least 1 more raw iron from my opponent.  I can offer my 2 raw copper in exchange for 2 of their raw iron.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:raw_copper * 2, ] together with a text message: I'm trying to craft a bucket and need more iron. I have some extra raw copper I can trade you for some of your raw iron.  Would you be willing to trade 2 raw iron for my 2 raw copper?


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I need to evaluate this trade proposal in the context of my goal, which is to craft a stone_shovel. Let me first check the recipe for a stone_shovel to understand what materials I need.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **stone_shovel**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I see that to craft a stone_shovel, I need: 1. 2 sticks 2. 1 stone_tool_material (which can be cobblestone)  Let me check what I currently have: - minecraft:raw_copper: 1 - minecraft:raw_iron: 3 - minecraft:stick: 4 - minecraft:stone: 2  And what player 1 is proposing: - I give: 2 raw_iron - I receive: 2 raw_copper  For my stone_shovel target, I need sticks (which I already have 4) and stone/cobblestone. I already have 2 stone, which should be sufficient for crafting the shovel. I don't need raw_copper for my target item.  Let me check if stone can be used directly or if I need to convert it to something else.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **stone**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- Now I understand better. I have 2 stone, which is not directly usable for a stone_shovel. According to the recipe, I need stone_tool_materials, which includes cobblestone. Let me check if I can use stone directly for a stone_shovel or if I need to convert it.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **cobblestone**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I need to determine if this trade helps me reach my goal of crafting a stone_shovel. Let me analyze what I need and what I have.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **stone_shovel**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- To craft a stone_shovel, I need: 1. 2 sticks 2. 1 cobblestone (as part of the #stone_tool_materials tag)  Looking at my current inventory: - minecraft:raw_copper: 1 - minecraft:raw_iron: 3 - minecraft:stick: 4 - minecraft:stone: 2  I already have 4 sticks, which is more than enough for the 2 sticks needed. I have 2 stone, but I need cobblestone specifically for the stone_shovel. Stone and cobblestone are different items in Minecraft.  The proposed trade: - I give: 2 raw_iron - I receive: 2 raw_copper  This trade doesn't directly help me get cobblestone, which is what I need for my stone_shovel. Raw copper isn't used in the stone_shovel recipe. While I could potentially use raw_copper for other trades later, it doesn't directly advance my goal.  Additionally, raw_iron is generally more valuable than raw_copper in Minecraft, so this trade isn't particularly favorable from a value perspective either.  Since I already have 2 stone, I should focus on either: 1. Converting my stone to cobblestone (though this isn't typically possible in Minecraft) 2. Acquiring cobblestone through other means or trades  This particular trade doesn't help me progress toward my stone_shovel goal, so I should reject it.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2 decided to reject the proposal with a text message: I appreciate the offer, but I need to focus on getting cobblestone for my crafting goals right now. Raw copper doesn't help me with what I'm trying to make. I'd be happy to trade if you have cobblestone to offer instead.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- Let me first understand what I need to craft a stone shovel and what resources I currently have. I'll check the recipe for a stone shovel.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket. I need 3 iron ingots to craft it. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron. I need 1 more iron ingot, which means I need to smelt another raw iron.  I have 2 raw copper in hand. Player 2 has 3 raw iron, 1 raw copper, 4 sticks, and 2 stone. I failed to trade for raw iron last turn.  Since Player 2 rejected my offer for raw iron last turn, indicating they don't need raw copper, I need to rethink my trading strategy.  Maybe they need fuel? I don't have any fuel to offer.  I could try offering both my raw copper for 1 raw iron, but that might be too much.
- I need to confirm the bucket recipe.  Also, I should check what I can do with raw copper, just in case I can't get any more iron.
- Okay, I've confirmed the bucket recipe and what I can do with raw copper.  Since I don't have any fuel, I'll try trading my raw copper for raw iron again. This time, I'll offer both my raw copper for a single raw iron.  If that fails, I'll have to consider crafting something else.  Maybe I can get sticks from Player 2 and try to make a different tool.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- Let me first understand what I need to craft a stone shovel and what resources I currently have. I'll check the recipe for a stone shovel.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket. I need 3 iron ingots to craft it. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron. I need 1 more iron ingot, which means I need to smelt another raw iron.  I have 2 raw copper in hand. Player 2 has 3 raw iron, 1 raw copper, 4 sticks, and 2 stone. I failed to trade for raw iron last turn, even offering 1 raw copper for 1 raw iron and a fraction of a plank.  Player 2 stated they needed cobblestone.  I don't have any.
- Confirming the bucket recipe.  I also need to figure out how to get that last iron ingot.  Trading for it directly hasn't worked.  Player 2 needs cobblestone.  Maybe I can craft something that can help me get cobblestone, and then trade *that* for the iron.
- Stone can be crafted into cobblestone.  Player 2 has stone.  Maybe I can trade for some stone, turn it into cobblestone, and then trade the cobblestone for the iron I need.  This is a long shot, but it's worth a try.  <current status>
- I think I have a plan.

- My target is a bucket. I need 3 iron ingots to craft it. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron. I need 1 more iron ingot, which means I need to smelt another raw iron.  I have 2 raw copper in hand. Player 2 has 3 raw iron, 1 raw copper, 4 sticks, and 2 stone. I've tried trading for raw iron multiple times, offering raw copper, but Player 2 has consistently rejected my offers.  They've stated they need cobblestone, which I can't craft directly.  My previous attempt to trade for stone to make cobblestone also failed.  I need a new approach.  Player 2 has sticks.  Maybe I can craft something with sticks that they might want?
- Sticks can be used to craft tools, torches, and other useful items.  Player 2 already has sticks, so they probably don't need more.  However, they might need *tools* made from sticks.  I could try crafting a wooden pickaxe or a wooden sword and offering that in a trade for raw iron.  I'll need planks for that, though.
- I don't have any planks, so I can't craft tools directly.  I'm at a bit of an impasse.  I need iron, Player 2 has iron, but they don't want what I have to offer.  My best bet might be to try and get some planks from Player 2, even though they likely need them themselves.  It's a long shot, but it's better than nothing.  <current status>

I have 2 raw copper in hand. Player 2 has 3 raw iron, 1 raw copper, 4 sticks, and 2 stone.  Previous attempts to trade for raw iron and stone have failed.  Player 2 has rejected my offers of raw copper.  They seem to need cobblestone or planks, but I have neither.  I need to find something they *do* want.  Since they have sticks and stone, they might be trying to craft tools.  Perhaps I can offer them a crafted tool in exchange for the raw iron?
- An iron pickaxe requires 3 iron ingots and 2 sticks. I only have 1 iron ingot, so I can't craft that.  A wooden pickaxe requires 3 planks and 2 sticks. I don't have planks.  A stone pickaxe requires 3 cobblestone and 2 sticks.  I don't have cobblestone.  I'm still stuck.  I need to find a way to get either planks or cobblestone to craft something Player 2 might want.  Maybe I should try one last time to trade for the raw iron directly, offering a very generous trade.  If that fails, I'll focus on trying to get either planks or cobblestone.  <current status>

I have 2 raw copper in hand. Player 2 has 3 raw iron, 1 raw copper, 4 sticks, and 2 stone.  All my previous attempts to trade for raw iron have failed. Player 2 seems to be prioritizing sticks and stone, likely for tool crafting.  I need to find a way to make my offer more appealing. Since I can't craft anything useful with my current resources, my best bet is to offer a very generous trade for the raw iron, even if it means giving up all my copper.  <current status>

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- Looking at the recipe for a stone shovel, we need: 1. 2 sticks 2. 1 stone tool material (cobblestone)  Checking our current inventory: - minecraft:raw_copper: 1 - minecraft:raw_iron: 3 - minecraft:stick: 4 - minecraft:stone: 2  And our opponent's inventory: - minecraft:iron_ingot: 1 - minecraft:raw_copper: 2 - minecraft:raw_iron: 2  We already have all the materials needed to craft a stone shovel: - We have 4 sticks (only need 2) - We have 2 stone (which can be used as the stone tool material)  However, I should check if stone can directly be used as a stone tool material or if we need cobblestone specifically.

Stone is made from cobblestone + fuel, but we can't convert it back. We need to acquire cobblestone through trading.  Our opponent doesn't have cobblestone either, but they might be able to get it in future turns. We have plenty of raw iron (3) and sticks (4), which could be valuable to our opponent. We could offer some of our raw iron in exchange for something that might help us now or in the future.  Since our opponent has raw copper, and we only have 1, we could request more raw copper which might be useful for crafting other items or for future trades. We could also offer some of our sticks since we have more than we need for the stone shovel.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`

Let me know if this works for you!


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a bucket.  A bucket requires 3 iron ingots. I already have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron.  If I accept this trade, I'll have 3 raw iron and can smelt them into an iron ingot. Then with a total of 3 iron ingots, I can craft a bucket. This trade gets me closer to my goal.

I can smelt my 3 raw iron into 3 iron ingots, but I need fuel.  Player 2 has no coal, but he does have sticks, which I also have.  Perhaps I can trade some raw iron for more sticks to use as fuel.
- I need to review how to make iron ingots to confirm the fuel requirements.  Also, I should check if there's anything else I can make with my current resources that might be useful for trading or getting closer to my goal.  Trading for more sticks might be a good idea, as they can be used as fuel or to craft other tools.
- I have enough raw iron to make the remaining 2 iron ingots I need for the bucket. My main problem is fuel. I have 2 sticks, which can be used as fuel, but I'd prefer to trade for more if possible.

## 🌀 Turn 5 start!
----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I need 3 iron ingots to make a bucket. I already have one, so I need two more.  I have 3 raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots. To smelt raw iron, I need fuel, which could be coal or planks. Player 2 has no coal, but does have sticks and stone. I can offer some raw iron for sticks, which I can craft into planks and use as fuel.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **iron_ingot**.


### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:stick * 2, ], offer [minecraft:raw_iron * 1, ] together with a text message: I'd like to trade 1 raw iron for 2 sticks. Let me know if you're interested.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I need to evaluate this trade proposal in terms of my target item, which is a stone shovel. Let me first check what's needed to craft a stone shovel.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **stone_shovel**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I now understand that to craft a stone shovel, I need: 1. 2 sticks 2. 1 stone tool material (which can be cobblestone)  Looking at my current inventory: - 3 raw copper - 2 raw iron - 2 sticks - 2 stone  The trade proposal is asking me to give 2 sticks in exchange for 1 raw iron. Let me analyze this:  - I currently have exactly 2 sticks, which is precisely what I need for my stone shovel - If I trade away my sticks, I would have 0 sticks left and would need to craft more - I would gain 1 raw iron, bringing my total to 3 raw iron - I already have 2 stone, which should work for the stone tool material requirement  This trade would be detrimental to my goal of crafting a stone shovel because I would lose the exact number of sticks I need. Let me check if I can craft sticks from other materials I have.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **stick**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I need to evaluate whether trading my 2 sticks for 1 raw iron helps me reach my target of crafting a stone shovel.  From the item information, I can see that a stone shovel requires: - 2 sticks - 1 stone tool material (like cobblestone)  Looking at my current inventory: - 3 raw copper - 2 raw iron - 2 sticks (exactly what I need for the shovel) - 2 stone (which should work as the stone material)  If I accept this trade: - I would lose all my sticks (2) - I would gain 1 raw iron (bringing my total to 3)  This is problematic because: 1. I would no longer have the sticks needed for my stone shovel 2. I don't currently have any planks to craft more sticks (sticks require planks)  While raw iron is valuable, it doesn't help me with my immediate goal of crafting a stone shovel. I already have the exact materials I need (2 sticks + 2 stone), and trading away my sticks would set me back.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2 decided to reject the proposal with a text message: I need to keep my sticks to craft my target item. I can't spare them right now, but I might be interested in trading other materials.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket, which requires 3 iron ingots. I currently have 1 iron ingot, 3 raw iron, and 2 sticks.  Player 2 has 3 raw copper, 2 raw iron, 2 sticks, and 2 stone. I need 2 more iron ingots. I can smelt my raw iron into ingots. I have enough sticks for fuel.
- I confirmed the recipe for a bucket. Now I need to plan the crafting steps.  <current status>
- I have enough raw iron and sticks to craft the bucket.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:

Current hand: - minecraft:raw_copper: 3 - minecraft:raw_iron: 2 - minecraft:stick: 2 - minecraft:stone: 2  I already have 2 sticks, which is exactly what I need.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- Looking at the recipe information, I need to craft a stone shovel which requires 2 sticks and 1 cobblestone. I currently have: - 3 raw copper - 2 raw iron - 2 sticks - 2 stone  The recipe specifically shows that cobblestone is needed (under #stone_tool_materials), not regular stone. I need to either get cobblestone directly or find a way to convert my stone to cobblestone. However, the recipes show that cobblestone is actually used to make stone (with fuel), not the other way around.  Since I already have the 2 sticks needed, I need to focus on getting cobblestone. Let me check what my opponent (player 1) has: - 1 iron ingot - 3 raw iron - 2 sticks  Neither of us has cobblestone directly. I need to propose a trade that might help me get closer to my goal while offering something valuable to player 1.  Since player 1 seems to be collecting iron (they already have an iron ingot and raw iron), I could offer some of my raw copper in exchange for something that might help me get cobblestone. However, they don't have cobblestone either.  I should make a proposal that advances my position while appearing beneficial to them. I'll offer some raw copper (which I have plenty of) and ask for something that might help me in future crafting or trading.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:iron_ingot * 1, ], offer [minecraft:raw_copper * 1, ] together with a text message: I notice you have an iron ingot that I could use for crafting tools. I'm willing to trade you some raw copper for it, which would help you diversify your resources. This would be beneficial for both of us as we work toward our crafting goals.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket, which requires iron ingots. Trading away my only iron ingot for raw copper, which doesn't directly contribute to my goal, seems counterproductive.  I need to keep my iron ingot.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1 decided to reject the proposal with a text message: I need the iron ingot to craft my target item.  Do you have any other materials you'd be willing to trade?


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- Let me first understand what I have and what I need to craft a stone shovel. I need to check the recipe for a stone shovel and see if I have the necessary materials or need to trade for them.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket. I need 3 iron ingots to craft it. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 3 raw iron.  Player 2 has 2 raw iron. I need to acquire at least 2 more raw iron from Player 2 to smelt into iron ingots. Player 2 has sticks and stone, which suggests they might be trying to craft tools, possibly a stone axe or pickaxe.  They also have raw copper, which they might be saving for something specific. I need to offer something enticing to get the raw iron.
- I'm checking the recipe for a bucket again to make sure I have it right. I also want to see if there are any intermediate steps I might have overlooked.
- I want to see what I can craft with my current resources. Maybe there's something I can make that Player 2 would be interested in trading for.  <current status>
- I can smelt my raw iron into iron ingots. This will give me a total of 4 iron ingots, enough for a bucket and an extra.  I can offer Player 2 an iron ingot for their 2 raw iron. This would benefit both of us.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- Let me first understand what I have and what I need to craft a stone shovel. I need to check the recipe for a stone shovel and see if I have the necessary materials or need to trade for them.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket. I need 3 iron ingots to craft it. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 3 raw iron.  Player 2 has 2 raw iron.

Player 2 has sticks and stone, which suggests they might be trying to craft tools, possibly a stone axe or pickaxe.  They also have raw copper, which they might be saving for something specific or might be willing to trade. I need to offer something enticing to get the raw iron.
- Double checking the bucket recipe to be absolutely sure.  No sense in misremembering and wasting resources.
- Checking how to make iron ingots, specifically what fuel I can use. I don't have any obvious fuel sources in my hand.
- I can smelt my raw iron into iron ingots. This will give me a total of 4 iron ingots, enough for a bucket and an extra.  However, I need fuel for the furnace. I don't have any coal or planks.  I need to consider how to get fuel.  Maybe Player 2 would trade some sticks for raw copper?  Or maybe I should offer the extra iron ingot for the raw iron *and* some sticks?

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- Let me first understand what I have and what I need to craft a stone shovel. I need to check the recipe for a stone shovel and see if I have the necessary materials or need to trade for them.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket. I need 3 iron ingots to craft it. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 3 raw iron.  Player 2 has 2 raw iron. I need to acquire at least 2 more raw iron from Player 2 to smelt into iron ingots. Player 2 has sticks and stone, which suggests they might be trying to craft tools, possibly a stone axe or pickaxe.  They also have raw copper, which they might be saving for something specific or might be willing to trade. I need to offer something enticing to get the raw iron.  A stick is enough fuel to smelt one raw iron, so I need at least two sticks.
- Double checking the bucket recipe to be absolutely sure.  No sense in misremembering and wasting resources.
- Checking how to make iron ingots, specifically what fuel I can use and how much I need.
- I can smelt my raw iron into iron ingots. This will give me a total of 4 iron ingots, enough for a bucket and an extra.  However, I need fuel for the furnace. I don't have any coal or planks.  I need to consider how to get fuel.  Maybe Player 2 would trade some sticks for raw copper?  Or maybe I should offer the extra iron ingot for the raw iron *and* some sticks?  Since Player 2 rejected my previous offer of raw copper for sticks, I'll try offering an iron ingot for the raw iron and sticks.  If that fails, I'll try offering more raw copper for the sticks and raw iron.

## 🌀 Turn 7 start!
----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I need more iron ingots to craft a bucket.  I have raw iron, but I need a furnace and fuel to smelt it.  I could offer player 2 my sticks for some raw copper or stone, which could be used as fuel.  Maybe they'd be willing to trade an iron ingot directly.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **bucket**.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I need 2 more iron ingots.  Trading my sticks might incentivize player 2 to trade an iron ingot.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [iron_ingot * 1, ], offer [stick * 2, ] together with a text message: I have extra sticks if you need them. I'm looking for another iron ingot to finish a project. Would you be willing to trade?


### 🖥 Server Event: `server__proposal_invalid`
player 1's proposal is INVALID according to the game rule.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I need two more iron ingots to craft a bucket.  Player 2 has two raw iron, which I could smelt into an ingot, but ideally, I'd like to trade for an already smelted ingot if possible. I could offer my two sticks, as they aren't directly useful for my bucket goal.  However, player 2 has rejected stick offers before.  Maybe offering raw iron would be more enticing.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **bucket**.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I need two more iron ingots. Player 2 has two raw iron.  I could offer one raw iron for one of their raw iron, hoping they'll value the even trade. If not, I can try offering two raw iron for one of theirs.  I'll emphasize that this trade helps them consolidate their resources.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:raw_iron * 1, ], offer [minecraft:raw_iron * 1, ] together with a text message: I'm looking to consolidate my raw iron. Would you be willing to trade one raw iron for one raw iron? This would help us both organize our inventories.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- Let me analyze this proposal. Player 1 wants to trade 1 raw_iron for 1 raw_iron, which is essentially a 1:1 trade of the same item. This seems like a strange proposal since we'd both end up with the same amount of raw_iron as before.  My target item is a stone_shovel. Let me check what I need to craft a stone_shovel.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **stone_shovel**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- Looking at the recipe for a stone_shovel, I need: 1. 2 sticks 2. 1 stone tool material (which can be cobblestone)  Checking my current inventory: - 3 raw_copper - 2 raw_iron - 2 sticks - 2 stone  I already have all the materials I need to craft a stone shovel! I have 2 sticks and 2 stone. The stone should work as the stone tool material.  This proposal from player 1 to trade 1 raw_iron for 1 raw_iron doesn't make any sense from a gameplay perspective - we'd both end up with the same amount of raw_iron as before. It seems like a pointless trade that doesn't benefit either of us.  Since I already have what I need to craft my target item (stone shovel), there's no reason to engage in this meaningless trade. It's possible player 1 is trying to distract me or waste a turn.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2 decided to reject the proposal with a text message: I don't see any benefit in trading the same item with the same quantity. I already have what I need for my crafting goals, but thank you for the offer.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- Let me first understand what I need to craft a stone shovel and what resources I currently have. I'll check the recipe for a stone shovel.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket. I need 3 iron ingots to craft it. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 3 raw iron. I can smelt the raw iron into iron ingots. Player 2 has 2 raw iron, which I could potentially trade for.  Player 2 has been rejecting my proposals for sticks and raw copper. He seems to be focused on crafting something with sticks and stone. He keeps asking for cobblestone, which I don't have. I need to figure out a way to get more iron ingots.
- I've reviewed the bucket recipe. I need to focus on getting more iron ingots.  Smelting my raw iron is the most direct path. I need to consider what I can offer Player 2 that he might actually accept.  <current status>
- I'll try offering my 2 sticks for his 2 raw iron. It's a fair trade, and it might be more appealing to him than my previous offers. If he accepts, I can smelt the raw iron and craft the bucket.

He keeps asking for cobblestone, which I don't have.  He also rejected my offer of sticks for his iron ingot. I need to figure out a way to get more iron ingots or consider an alternative crafting path if acquiring more iron becomes impossible.
- I've reviewed the iron ingot recipe.  Smelting raw iron is the primary way to obtain it. I need to try one more time to trade for Player 2's raw iron. If that fails, I need to consider alternative strategies.  Perhaps there's a different item I could craft that would be useful, even if it's not my primary target.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket. I need 3 iron ingots to craft it. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 3 raw iron. I can smelt the raw iron into iron ingots. Player 2 has 2 raw iron, which I could potentially trade for.  Player 2 has been rejecting my proposals for sticks and raw copper. He seems to be focused on crafting something with sticks and stone. He keeps asking for cobblestone, which I don't have. He also rejected my offer of sticks for his iron ingot.  He *did* accept a trade of raw copper for sticks and iron earlier, but then rejected a later offer of sticks for iron.  This suggests he might value raw copper more than sticks, or that his needs have changed. I need to figure out a way to get more iron ingots or consider an alternative crafting path if acquiring more iron becomes impossible.
- I've reviewed the iron ingot recipe.  Smelting raw iron is the primary way to obtain it. I'll try offering my iron ingot for his 2 raw iron. This is a slight overpay on my part, but getting the bucket is the priority. If that fails, I'll offer all my sticks *and* the iron ingot for his 2 raw iron.  If *that* fails, I need to seriously consider alternative strategies.

- I need to make a proposal to player 1 that will help me craft a stone shovel. Let me first check what I need to craft a stone shovel.
- I see that to craft a stone shovel, I need: - 2 sticks - 3 stone  Looking at my current inventory: - minecraft:raw_copper: 3 - minecraft:raw_iron: 2 - minecraft:stick: 2 - minecraft:stone: 2  I have the 2 sticks needed, but I only have 2 stone and I need 3. I need to get 1 more stone.  Let me check what player 1 has: - minecraft:iron_ingot: 1 - minecraft:raw_iron: 3 - minecraft:stick: 2  Player 1 doesn't have any stone. I need to find a way to get more stone. Since I can't directly get stone from player 1, I need to consider what I can trade that might help me in crafting more stone later or getting resources that could be useful.  Looking at our inventories, I notice player 1 has more raw iron than me, and I have raw copper that player 1 might need. I could propose a trade of some of my raw copper for some of player 1's raw iron. This might help me later if I need to craft tools to get more stone.  I'll propose trading 1 of my raw copper for 1 of player 1's raw iron. This seems like a fair trade that might benefit both of us.

Perhaps I could trade for more sticks, which would allow me to craft other tools that might help me get stone.  Let me make a proposal offering some of my raw copper in exchange for sticks.

Since neither of us has cobblestone directly, I should consider what might be valuable to my opponent while not giving away items I need.  My opponent seems to be collecting iron (they have both raw iron and an iron ingot). They previously tried to trade for more raw iron and sticks. I could offer some of my raw iron in exchange for something that might help me, or I could try to get their iron ingot which might be useful for crafting tools.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:

player 1 decided to reject the proposal with a text message: I need the iron ingot for my own crafting goals. Thanks for the offer though.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket. I need 3 iron ingots to craft it. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 3 raw iron.  Player 2 has 2 raw iron. If I can get 1 more raw iron, I can smelt it into an ingot and then craft the bucket. Player 2 has sticks and stone, which suggests they might be trying to craft tools or a furnace.  I need to focus on getting more iron.
- Reviewing the recipe for a bucket to make sure I have the correct requirements.
- Checking what I can craft with my current resources. I can smelt raw iron into iron ingots.  <current status>
- I need to trade for more raw iron.  I'll offer Player 2 my 2 sticks for 1 raw iron.  They might need sticks for tools, and I don't need them for my bucket.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket. I need 3 iron ingots to craft it. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 3 raw iron.  Player 2 has 2 raw iron. If I can get both, I can smelt them into ingots and then craft the bucket. Player 2 has 3 raw copper, 2 raw iron, 2 sticks, and 2 stone, which suggests they might be trying to craft tools, a furnace, or something involving copper.  I need to focus on getting more iron. I've tried trading for iron before, offering sticks and raw copper, but Player 2 hasn't been interested.
- Double checking the bucket recipe.
- Seeing what I can craft now. I can smelt my raw iron into an ingot.  <current status>
- I need to try a different trade.  Since Player 2 has shown interest in copper before, maybe I should offer something else along with the sticks to make the trade more appealing. I'll offer my 2 sticks AND my existing iron ingot for their 2 raw iron. This is a risk, as it leaves me with no iron ingots, but if I get the 2 raw iron, I can smelt them into ingots and be closer to my goal.

- Double checking the bucket recipe.
- Seeing what I can craft now. I can smelt my raw iron into an ingot.  <current status>
- I need to try a different approach.  Perhaps Player 2 is saving their raw iron for something specific. I'll offer them something they might need more – my sticks – and ask for something they might be more willing to part with – raw copper.  If I can get enough raw copper, I can try to trade that with Player 2 for their raw iron later.

- I need to drastically change my approach.  Since direct trades for iron haven't worked, I need to consider what Player 2 might be crafting and offer something that helps them.  They have stone, which could be for a furnace, but they also have sticks, suggesting tools.  Maybe they are trying to make shears (2 iron ingots). I'll offer a risky trade: all my resources (1 iron ingot, 3 raw iron, and 2 sticks) for their 2 raw iron. This is a gamble, but if it works, I'll have enough iron to make the bucket. If it doesn't, I'm in a worse position, but continued failed trades are getting me nowhere.

They have stone, which could be for a furnace, but they also have sticks, suggesting tools.  Perhaps offering a crafted item would be more enticing. I can craft a stone pickaxe if I trade my sticks for Player 2's stone. Then I can offer the pickaxe to Player 2 for their raw iron.

## 🌀 Turn 9 start!
----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I need more iron ingots to craft a bucket.  I have plenty of raw iron, but player 2 has more. I could try trading some sticks for more raw iron.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **bucket**.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I need 3 iron ingots total for the bucket, and I currently have 1.  I have 3 raw iron, and Player 2 has 2.  If I could get Player 2's raw iron, I could smelt it into more ingots.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **iron_ingot**.


### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:stick * 2, ] together with a text message: I'd like to trade 2 sticks for 2 raw iron.  I'm trying to craft a bucket and need more iron. Let me know if you're interested.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I need to evaluate this trade proposal in the context of my goal, which is to craft a stone_shovel. Let me first check the recipe for a stone_shovel to understand what materials I need.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **stone_shovel**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- Now I understand what I need to craft a stone_shovel. The recipe requires: - 2 sticks - 1 stone tool material (which can be cobblestone)  Looking at my current inventory: - minecraft:raw_copper: 3 - minecraft:raw_iron: 2 - minecraft:stick: 2 - minecraft:stone: 2  I already have exactly 2 sticks, which is the exact amount needed for a stone_shovel. I also have 2 stone, which should work for the stone tool material requirement. So I already have all the materials I need to craft my target item.  Player 1 is offering me 2 more sticks in exchange for my 2 raw_iron. Since I already have the exact number of sticks I need, getting more sticks doesn't help me reach my goal. Additionally, giving away my raw_iron might be disadvantageous if I need it later for something else.  It seems like Player 1 is trying to collect iron to craft a bucket (which typically requires 3 iron ingots). They already have 1 iron ingot and 3 raw iron, so with my 2 raw iron, they would have enough to craft a bucket after smelting.  Since this trade doesn't help me progress toward my goal and would only benefit my opponent, I should reject this proposal.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2 decided to reject the proposal with a text message: I'm sorry, but I need to keep my raw iron. I already have the sticks I need for my crafting goals.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- Let me first understand what I need to craft a stone shovel and what resources I currently have. Then I'll determine if I can craft it directly or what trades I might need.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket. I need 3 iron ingots to craft it. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 3 raw iron.  Player 2 has 2 raw iron. I need a total of 7 raw iron to make 3 iron ingots (and thus the bucket). I need to get 1 more raw iron from Player 2. He has sticks and stone, which I don't particularly need, but maybe I can offer him something in return. He also has 3 raw copper.
- I need to figure out what Player 2 might be trying to craft. He seems to want raw copper, but has rejected my offers of sticks. He also rejected my offer of raw iron for his sticks. He seems to be holding onto his sticks tightly.  He also has stone.
- Let's see what I can craft with what I have. Maybe I can craft something to trade with Player 2.  <current status>
- I can smelt my raw iron into iron ingots.  If I smelt all 3 raw iron, I'll have a total of 2.5 iron ingots (after discarding the fractional part, I'll have 2).  I still need 1 more iron ingot to craft the bucket. I'll propose a trade with Player 2 for his 2 raw iron, offering him my 2 sticks.

He has sticks and stone, which I don't particularly need, but maybe I can offer him something in return. He also has 3 raw copper. He seems reluctant to trade his raw iron or sticks.
- Confirming the recipe for a bucket.  I also need to consider what Player 2 might be crafting. He has stone, sticks, raw iron, and raw copper.  He seems to want raw copper, but perhaps he's collecting it for something specific.  He's rejected my offers of sticks and raw iron for his sticks, so he's definitely holding onto them for a reason.
- Checking the uses of sticks.  They are used in a lot of recipes, so it's hard to pinpoint what Player 2 is aiming for.  He might be making tools, torches, or something else entirely.
- Let's see what I can craft with what I have. Maybe I can craft something to trade with Player 2.  <current status>
- I can smelt my raw iron into iron ingots.  If I smelt all 3 raw iron, I'll have a total of 2.5 iron ingots (after discarding the fractional part, I'll have 2).  I still need 1 more iron ingot to craft the bucket.  Since Player 2 seems reluctant to part with his raw iron, I'll try a different approach. I'll offer him my 1 iron ingot for his 2 raw iron. This might seem like an overpayment on my part, but getting the bucket quickly is my priority.

He has sticks and stone, which I don't particularly need, but maybe I can offer him something in return. He also has 3 raw copper. He has consistently rejected my offers involving sticks and seems reluctant to trade his raw iron.
- Confirming the recipe for a bucket.  I also need to consider what Player 2 might be crafting. He has stone, sticks, raw iron, and raw copper.  He mentioned needing cobblestone, which suggests he might be aiming for something that requires it, like a furnace or stone tools.
- A furnace requires cobblestone, which Player 2 can get by smelting stone. He already has stone, so he likely needs the fuel for the furnace.  This might explain why he's holding onto his sticks.
- I can smelt my raw iron into iron ingots.  If I smelt all 3 raw iron, I'll have a total of 2.5 iron ingots (after discarding the fractional part, I'll have 2).  I still need 1 more iron ingot to craft the bucket.  Since Player 2 seems reluctant to part with his raw iron and likely needs fuel, I'll offer him my 1 iron ingot for his 2 raw iron *and* 1 stick. This gives him a small amount of fuel to potentially start his crafting, and gets me closer to my goal.

I need to either convert my stone to cobblestone or trade for cobblestone. Since I can't see a direct way to convert stone to cobblestone (only the other way around), I should try to trade for cobblestone.  Looking at player 1's inventory, they don't have cobblestone either. However, they seem to be trying to craft something with iron (possibly a bucket based on their previous messages). I could offer some of my raw iron in exchange for something I might need later, or try to get them to help me find cobblestone in future turns.  Since I need to make a proposal now, I'll offer some of my raw copper (which I have plenty of) in exchange for some of their sticks. This would give me more sticks for potential future crafting while not giving up my raw iron which I might need later.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:stick * 1, ], offer [minecraft:raw_copper * 1, ] together with a text message: I notice we both have some sticks, but I could use one more for my crafting plans. I can offer you some raw copper in exchange, which might be useful for your future crafting needs. This seems like a fair trade that could benefit us both.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket, which requires iron ingots.  I already have one iron ingot and 3 raw iron.  Raw copper is not directly useful for my target. However, having more diverse materials could be helpful for future trades.  Since I have 2 sticks, trading one for raw copper might be beneficial if I can later trade the raw copper for something I need, like more iron.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **bucket**.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I need two more iron ingots to craft a bucket. Trading a stick for raw copper doesn't directly help me get there.  It's unlikely Player 2 would trade iron for copper.  I should hold onto my sticks in case they become useful for a trade later.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`

Player 2 has 2 raw iron, which I could potentially trade for.  He also has sticks and stone, which I don't currently need. He seems interested in raw copper, which I don't have, and my iron ingot.
- I need to figure out how to get 2 more iron ingots. I can smelt my 3 raw iron, which will give me 1 more iron ingot, and then I need to trade for 1 more.  I need to find a trade that Player 2 will accept.
- Let's see what I can craft with what I have.  <current status>
- I can smelt my raw iron into an ingot. Then I'll have 2 iron ingots. I still need one more to craft the bucket.  Player 2 has 2 raw iron. If I could trade for that, I could win.

- My target is a bucket. I need 3 iron ingots to craft it. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 3 raw iron. I can smelt the raw iron into iron ingots. Player 2 has 2 raw iron, which I could potentially trade for. He also has sticks and stone, which I don't currently need. He has consistently rejected trades for his raw iron, even when offered seemingly good deals. He seems most interested in trading for my iron ingot, but I need all my iron for the bucket.
- I need to figure out how to get 2 more iron ingots. I can smelt my 3 raw iron, which will give me 1 more iron ingot, and then I need to trade for 1 more.  I need to find a trade that Player 2 will accept.  He hasn't accepted any of my previous offers.  I need to analyze his behavior. He keeps mentioning needing things for *his* crafting goals.  Maybe I should try to figure out what his target is.  He has raw copper, raw iron, sticks, and stone.
- Let's see what I can craft with what I have.  <current status>
- I can smelt my raw iron into an ingot. Then I'll have 2 iron ingots. I still need one more to craft the bucket.  Player 2 has 2 raw iron. If I could trade for that, I could win.  He has rejected trades for sticks, my iron ingot alone, and even my iron ingot and sticks together.  He keeps saying he needs things for his crafting goals.  He has raw copper, raw iron, sticks, and stone.  He mentioned needing cobblestone earlier.  Could he be trying to make shears?  Shears require 2 iron ingots. He has enough raw iron to make two if he smelts it, but maybe he's trying to conserve fuel.  If he *is* trying to make shears, he might be willing to trade his raw copper and stone for my iron ingot.

Perhaps he's trying to make a sword or tools?  Those require sticks and some other material like cobblestone, planks, or ingots.  He's holding onto his raw iron, so he's likely not making stone tools.  He might be making a wooden sword or pickaxe.  If that's the case, he might be willing to trade his raw iron for my iron ingot, since he could use that to make a better tool.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I need more iron ingots to craft a bucket.  Player 2 has raw iron, but hasn't seemed interested in trading it for raw copper or sticks. Maybe I should offer my iron ingot to see if they'll offer multiple raw iron in return. I could also offer my sticks, since Player 2 has expressed interest in them before, but I'm hesitant to give up my only iron ingot.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **bucket**.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I need 3 iron ingots total, and I only have one.  I'll offer my one iron ingot and my two sticks for 2 of their raw iron.  That way, I can smelt the raw iron into iron ingots and have enough to make the bucket.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:iron_ingot * 1, minecraft:stick * 2, ] together with a text message: I'm willing to trade my iron ingot and my two sticks for two of your raw iron.  I'm trying to craft something that requires more iron, and this trade would really help me out. Let me know what you think!


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I need to evaluate this trade based on my target item, which is a stone_shovel. Let me first check what I need to craft a stone_shovel.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **stone_shovel**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I see that to craft a stone_shovel, I need: 1. 2 sticks 2. 1 stone_tool_material (which can be cobblestone)  Looking at my current inventory, I have: - 3 raw_copper - 2 raw_iron - 2 sticks - 2 stone  And the trade offer is: - I give: 2 raw_iron - I receive: 1 iron_ingot and 2 sticks  For my stone_shovel target, I need sticks and stone. I already have 2 sticks and 2 stone, which is exactly what I need to craft my target item. The raw_iron isn't directly needed for my target.  If I accept this trade, I would have: - 3 raw_copper - 0 raw_iron - 4 sticks (2 current + 2 from trade) - 2 stone - 1 iron_ingot  This would give me 4 sticks instead of 2, which is more than I need for my stone_shovel. The iron_ingot isn't directly useful for my target.  Let me check if stone is the same as cobblestone for crafting purposes.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **stone**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I see that stone and cobblestone are different items in Minecraft. Let me check if my stone can be used directly for a stone_shovel or if I need cobblestone specifically.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- Based on the item information, I can see that to craft a stone_shovel, I need: 1. 2 sticks 2. 1 cobblestone (as part of the #stone_tool_materials tag)  Looking at my current inventory: - 3 raw_copper - 2 raw_iron - 2 sticks - 2 stone  The trade offer is: - I give: 2 raw_iron - I receive: 1 iron_ingot and 2 sticks  The key issue is that I have stone but not cobblestone. Stone and cobblestone are different items in Minecraft, and the recipe specifically requires cobblestone (or other stone_tool_materials). My 2 stone cannot be directly used to craft a stone_shovel.  If I accept this trade, I would have: - 3 raw_copper - 0 raw_iron - 4 sticks (2 current + 2 from trade) - 2 stone - 1 iron_ingot  This gives me more sticks than I need, but I still don't have the cobblestone required for my target item. The iron_ingot isn't directly useful for my stone_shovel.  I need to find a way to either get cobblestone or convert my stone to cobblestone. Since I don't see a direct way to do that with my current inventory, and this trade doesn't help me get closer to my target, I should reject it.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`

- I need to review the bucket recipe to make sure I have the correct amounts. I also need to check the recipes for smelting iron ingots.
- I need to figure out what to offer Player 2. He seems interested in raw copper, but I don't have any. He's rejected my offers for sticks and raw iron.

We have 2 sticks and 2 stone, which is sufficient. However, I notice that player 1 has been trying to get more iron from us in previous turns, suggesting they might need it for their target.  Since we don't need any additional items from player 1 to craft our stone shovel, I could propose a trade that might be mutually beneficial. I could offer some of our raw copper (which we don't need for our stone shovel) in exchange for one of their iron ingots, which might be useful for us to craft other items if needed.  Let me check what raw copper can be used for:

They've also been protective of their iron ingots, rejecting our previous proposal when we asked for one.  Since we don't need any additional items from player 1 to craft our stone shovel, I could propose a trade that might be mutually beneficial. I'll offer some of our raw copper (which we don't need for our stone shovel) in exchange for something that might help us.  Based on previous rejected proposals, I should avoid asking for their iron ingots. Instead, I could propose trading some of our raw copper for some of their raw iron, which could give us more flexibility in crafting.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:raw_iron * 1, ], offer [minecraft:raw_copper * 2, ] together with a text message: I notice you've been looking for more iron. I can offer you 2 raw copper for 1 raw iron. This would help me with some additional crafting options while giving you materials you might need. What do you think?


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket, which requires iron ingots.  I already have 2 iron ingots and 2 raw iron. Trading 1 raw iron for 2 raw copper doesn't directly help me get more iron ingots.  Raw copper isn't useful for my target.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1 decided to reject the proposal with a text message: I need the raw iron to make more iron ingots for my target.  Thanks for the offer though.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- First, I need to understand what items are needed to craft a stone shovel and check if I have the necessary materials or need to trade for them.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket. I need 3 iron ingots to craft it. I currently have 2 iron ingots and 2 raw iron. I can smelt the raw iron into iron ingots. Player 2 has raw iron, sticks, raw copper, and stone.  He seems to be aiming for something that requires sticks, as he has rejected trades involving them. He has also consistently tried to trade for my iron ingot, suggesting he might need it for tools or other iron-based items.
- I need to see what I can craft with my current resources.  If I can smelt the raw iron, I will have enough to make the bucket.  <current status>
- I have enough raw iron to smelt into iron ingots and craft the bucket. I don't need to trade.

- My target is a bucket. I need 3 iron ingots to craft it. I currently have 2 iron ingots and 2 raw iron. I can smelt the raw iron into iron ingots, giving me a total of 4, enough for a bucket. Player 2 has raw copper, raw iron, sticks, and stone. He seems to be aiming for something that requires sticks, as he has rejected trades involving them. He has also consistently tried to trade for my iron ingot, suggesting he might need it for tools or other iron-based items.  Since I don't need anything from him, I'll focus on crafting my bucket.
- I should be able to smelt the raw iron and then craft the bucket.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket. I need 3 iron ingots to craft it. I currently have 2 iron ingots and 2 raw iron.  Smelting the raw iron will give me the 3rd iron ingot I need. Player 2 has raw copper, raw iron, sticks, and stone. He seems to be aiming for something that requires sticks, as he has rejected trades involving them. He has also consistently tried to trade for my iron ingot, suggesting he might need it for tools or other iron-based items.  Since I have everything I need, I'll focus on crafting my bucket this turn.
- I should have enough raw iron and fuel to smelt the raw iron into an ingot, and then craft the bucket.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I need to understand what items I need to craft a stone shovel and check if I have all the necessary materials. According to the item info, I need 2 sticks and 1 stone tool material (which can be cobblestone). Let me check what recipes I can make with my current items.
