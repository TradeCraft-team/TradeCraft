## 🌀 Turn 1 start!
----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I need to acquire iron ingots to craft a chain.  I see that player 2 has a lot of raw iron. I can offer them coal to smelt it, and request some of the resulting iron ingots in return.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **chain**.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I will offer coal as fuel for smelting, and request iron ingots in return.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:iron_ingot * 2, ], offer [minecraft:coal * 1, ] together with a text message: I have coal, which you can use to smelt your raw iron. I'd like to trade my coal for 2 iron ingots. Let me know if you're interested.


### 🖥 Server Event: `server__proposal_invalid`
player 1's proposal is INVALID according to the game rule.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I need to figure out how to craft a chain.  I know it requires iron, and player 2 has raw iron.  I'll check the recipe for a chain to be sure.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **chain**.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- Okay, I need iron ingots and iron nuggets to make a chain.  Player 2 has raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots. I have coal, which can be used as fuel for smelting.  I'll offer coal in exchange for some raw iron.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **iron_ingot**.


### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2 decided to reject the proposal with a text message: Maximum number of iterations reached without outputting correct information


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- First, I need to understand what a lever is and how to craft it. Let me check the recipe for a lever.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is 1 chain. I have cherry planks, coal, cobblestone, iron ingot, and raw copper.  My opponent has cobblestone, oak planks, raw copper, and raw iron. I need 2 iron ingots to make a chain. I currently have one, and my opponent has 5 raw iron which can be smelted into iron ingots. I tried to trade coal for 2 iron ingots, but the trade was rejected. I need to rethink my trading strategy.
- I need to figure out how to get another iron ingot.  Trading for raw iron and smelting it myself seems like the best option. I can offer my raw copper since I don't need it for my target.  <current status>
- I will offer my raw copper for 2 raw iron. This seems like a fair trade, and it gives me enough to craft the chain.

- My target is 1 chain. I have cherry planks, coal, cobblestone, iron ingot, and raw copper.  My opponent has cobblestone, oak planks, raw copper, and raw iron. I need 2 iron ingots to make a chain. My previous trade offer of coal for 2 iron ingots was rejected because the opponent doesn't have iron ingots, only raw iron. I need to adjust my trading strategy. Since my opponent has a lot of raw iron, they might not value it as much. I'll try trading for raw iron instead of iron ingots.
- I will offer my raw copper and coal for 3 raw iron. This should be enough to craft the chain, and the addition of coal might make the trade more appealing to my opponent.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__possible_recipes_from_hand`
player 2 is checking the posssible recipes from his/her hand crafts.


### 🖥 Server Event: `server__possible_recipes_from_hand`
Server shows the possible recipes of player 2 with his/her current hand crafts are:

   - oak button
   - iron ingot from smelting raw iron
   - iron ingot from blasting raw iron
   - copper ingot from smelting raw copper
   - copper ingot from blasting raw copper
   - stone


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is 1 chain. I have cherry planks, coal, cobblestone, iron ingot, and raw copper.  My opponent has cobblestone, oak planks, raw copper, and raw iron. I need 2 iron ingots to make a chain. My previous trade offer of coal for 2 iron ingots and then raw copper and coal for 3 raw iron were rejected.  My opponent likely needs the raw iron themselves or doesn't see the value in my offer. I need to analyze the situation further.
- I will offer my raw copper and cobblestone for 2 raw iron.  This simplifies the trade and focuses on what I need.  If this fails, I will try to deduce their target based on their resources and propose a more targeted trade in the next turn.

My previous trade offers have been rejected. My opponent likely needs the raw iron themselves or doesn't see enough value in my offers. I need to make a more compelling offer.
- I will offer my raw copper, cobblestone, AND cherry planks for 2 raw iron. This is a more significant offer, and hopefully, it will be enough to convince my opponent to trade.  If this fails, I will focus on gathering information about their potential target in the next turn and make a more targeted offer.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I need to craft a lever, which requires 1 cobblestone and 1 stick. I already have 1 cobblestone, but I need to craft a stick. Let me check the recipe for sticks.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **stick**.

My previous trade offers have been rejected. My opponent likely needs the raw iron themselves or doesn't see enough value in my offers. I need to make a more compelling offer, but I also need to consider the possibility that they are trying to prevent me from getting iron.
- I will offer almost everything I have except the coal for 2 raw iron. This demonstrates how much I need the iron and might entice them to trade. If this fails, I will assume they are actively blocking me and will shift my strategy to trying to deduce their target and disrupt their plans.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **stick**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I need to craft a lever, which requires 1 cobblestone and 1 stick. Looking at my current hand, I already have 1 cobblestone, but I need to make a stick. Sticks can be crafted from 2 planks, which gives 4 sticks. I already have oak_planks in my hand, so I can craft sticks later.  Looking at my opponent's hand, they have coal, cherry_planks, cobblestone, iron_ingot, and raw_copper. They might be interested in my raw_iron since they already have 1 iron_ingot and might want to make more. They also have coal which is needed to smelt raw_iron into iron_ingots.  For my proposal, I should offer some of my raw_iron in exchange for their coal, which would benefit both of us. I have 5 raw_iron, so I can spare some. I'll offer 2 raw_iron for their 1 coal.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:coal * 1, ], offer [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ] together with a text message: I see you have coal and I have raw_iron. I'm offering 2 raw_iron for your 1 coal. This is a fair trade as you can use the raw_iron with your coal to make more iron ingots. I need the coal to process some of my materials. This trade benefits both of us!


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a chain.  A chain requires 2 iron ingots and 1 chain link. I currently have 1 iron ingot.  Trading my coal for 2 raw iron would allow me to smelt the raw iron into iron ingots using the furnace. With 2 more iron ingots, I'd have 3 in total, enough for a chain if I can get a chain link. This trade seems beneficial for achieving my goal.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: I accept your trade. 2 raw iron for 1 coal sounds good.

- Confirming the chain recipe and checking if there are other ways to obtain the necessary components.  <current status>

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I need 2 iron ingots to craft a chain. I currently have 1 iron ingot.  I need 1 more. Player 2 has 2 iron ingots. I can try to trade for one. I also have 9 iron nuggets, which could be useful for something else, but not directly for a chain.  I'll offer my raw copper since I don't need it for the chain.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **chain**.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- The item info confirms I need 2 iron ingots.  I'll offer my raw copper and cobblestone for one iron ingot from Player 2.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:iron_ingot * 1, ], offer [minecraft:cobblestone * 1, minecraft:raw_copper * 1, ] together with a text message: I need one more iron ingot to craft a chain. I'm offering you my raw copper and cobblestone for one of your iron ingots. Let me know if you're interested.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I need to evaluate this trade proposal based on our target item, which is a lever. Let me first check the recipe for a lever to understand what ingredients I need.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **lever**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I see that to craft a lever, I need 1 cobblestone and 1 stick. I already have 1 cobblestone in my hand, so I don't need more cobblestone. Let me check how to craft a stick.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **stick**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- To craft a lever, I need 1 cobblestone and 1 stick. I already have 1 cobblestone in my hand, so I don't need more cobblestone. To make a stick, I need planks, and I already have oak_planks in my inventory which I can use to craft sticks.  Looking at the proposed trade: - Player 1 wants my 1 iron_ingot - Player 1 offers 1 cobblestone and 1 raw_copper  Since I already have the cobblestone I need for the lever, getting another cobblestone doesn't help me reach my goal. The raw_copper also doesn't appear to be useful for crafting a lever.  On the other hand, iron_ingot might be useful for other crafting recipes, though not directly for my lever target. Let me check if iron_ingot has any important uses that might help me indirectly.

- To craft a lever, I need 1 cobblestone and 1 stick. I already have 1 cobblestone in my hand, so I don't need more cobblestone. To make a stick, I need planks, and I already have oak_planks in my inventory which I can use to craft sticks.  Looking at the proposed trade: - Player 1 wants my 1 iron_ingot - Player 1 offers 1 cobblestone and 1 raw_copper  Since I already have the cobblestone I need for the lever, getting another cobblestone doesn't help me reach my goal. The raw_copper also doesn't appear to be useful for crafting a lever.  I currently have 2 iron ingots, and I can see from the recipes that iron ingots aren't directly needed for crafting a lever. However, I notice that Player 1 mentioned they need one more iron ingot to craft a chain. Looking at their inventory, they already have 1 iron ingot and 9 iron nuggets, so they're clearly working toward some goal that requires iron.  From a strategic perspective, I should consider: 1. I don't need the items Player 1 is offering to achieve my goal 2. I have 2 iron ingots, so giving up 1 still leaves me with another 3. Helping Player 1 might make them more willing to trade with me in the future if I need something  However, since I already have everything I need to craft my target item (lever), there's no strategic advantage in giving up a valuable resource like an iron ingot for items I don't need. I should keep my resources for potential future trades that might be more beneficial.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2 decided to reject the proposal with a text message: I appreciate the offer, but I already have the cobblestone I need, and I'd prefer to keep my iron ingot for now. I'm working toward a specific crafting goal that might require it.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a chain. I need 2 iron ingots and 1 iron nugget. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 9 iron nuggets.  Player 2 has 2 iron ingots. I need to trade for at least 1 more iron ingot.  I offered cobblestone for an iron ingot last turn, but Player 2 rejected it. I'll try offering raw copper this time.  <current status>
- I'll propose trading my raw copper for one of Player 2's iron ingots. If that's accepted, I can craft the chain. If not, I'll need to rethink my strategy.
- I'm confirming the chain recipe just in case.
- Checking possible recipes to see if there are any alternative crafting paths.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a chain. I need 2 iron ingots and 1 iron nugget. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 9 iron nuggets.  Player 2 has 2 iron ingots. I need to trade for at least 1 more iron ingot. My previous offers of cobblestone and then raw copper for an iron ingot were rejected. I need a new approach. Player 2 has previously expressed interest in coal, but I no longer have any.  <current status>
- I could try offering a larger quantity of iron nuggets for the iron ingot.  Since I have 9 nuggets, offering 4 or 5 might be enticing enough.  Alternatively, I could try to craft something Player 2 might want.  Let's see what I can make.
- Analyzing possible crafts.  I need to consider what Player 2 might need and what I can afford to trade.
- Reviewing the uses of iron ingots to anticipate Player 2's needs and potential crafting goals.  This might give me a clue about what to offer.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- First, I need to understand what a lever is and how to craft it. Let me check the recipe.
- Now I need to see what recipes I can make with my current hand.
- Let me check what a stick is and how to craft it, as it might be needed for the lever.
- I should also check what I can do with cobblestone since it's likely needed for the lever.
- I need to analyze the current game state and make a plan for crafting our target item, a lever.  Based on the information I've gathered, I now understand that to craft a lever, I need: 1. 1 stick 2. 1 cobblestone  I currently have: - 1 cobblestone - 2 iron ingots - 1 oak planks - 2 raw copper - 1 raw iron  To make a stick, I need planks. I have 1 oak planks, which can be used to craft sticks (2 planks → 4 sticks). Since I only need 1 stick for the lever, I need to find a way to craft with just 1 plank.  Let me check if there's a way to craft sticks with just 1 plank or if I need to acquire more planks.
- I need to understand if I can craft sticks with just 1 plank or if I need to find a way to get more planks.
- I need to make a comprehensive plan for crafting a lever.  Based on all the information I've gathered, here's my analysis:  1. To craft a lever, I need: - 1 stick - 1 cobblestone  2. I already have 1 cobblestone, so that part is covered.  3. To craft sticks, the recipe is: - 2 planks → 4 sticks  4. I only have 1 oak plank, which is not enough to craft sticks according to the standard recipe.  5. I need to determine if I can: - Use a fractional recipe (1 plank → 2 sticks) - Trade with the opponent to get more planks - Find another way to obtain sticks  Let me check if I can use a fractional recipe for crafting sticks.
- I have a good understanding of the situation now and can make a plan.

I'm running out of options.  <current status>
- I'll offer all my raw copper and cobblestone for a single iron ingot. It's a long shot, but it's worth a try. If that fails, I'll have to resort to offering a significant portion of my iron nuggets, even though that weakens my position if I do manage to get the ingot.
- Double-checking if there's anything I've missed that I could craft or offer.

- I need to make a trading proposal to help us craft a lever. Let me first check what items are needed to craft a lever.
- To craft a lever, we need: 1. 1 cobblestone 2. 1 stick  Looking at our current inventory: - We already have 1 cobblestone - We have oak_planks which can be used to craft sticks - We need to check the recipe for sticks

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- Great! I can see that we need 2 oak planks to craft 4 sticks. We currently have 1 oak plank, so we need 1 more oak plank to craft sticks.  Looking at our current inventory and the opponent's inventory: - We have: cobblestone (1), iron_ingot (2), oak_planks (1), raw_copper (2), raw_iron (1) - Opponent has: cobblestone (1), iron_ingot (1), iron_nugget (9), raw_copper (1), raw_iron (1)  The opponent doesn't have oak planks, but they might be interested in some of our resources. Let's think about what would be a good trade:  1. We need more oak planks to craft sticks 2. The opponent might be interested in our iron_ingot or raw_copper  Since we have 2 raw_copper and the opponent only has 1, I could offer 1 raw_copper and ask for something that might help us. The opponent has iron_nuggets which could be useful for crafting. Let's check what can be crafted with iron nuggets.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I see that 9 iron nuggets can be crafted into 1 iron ingot. The opponent has 9 iron nuggets, which they could use to craft an iron ingot.  Let's also check if there are any recipes that use raw_copper, which we have 2 of.
- Raw copper can be smelted into copper ingots. Let's check what copper ingots can be used for.
- Copper ingots can be crafted into copper blocks, but that doesn't help us with our lever goal.  Let's check what we can do with raw iron, since we have 1 and the opponent has 1 as well.
- Raw iron can be smelted into iron ingots. We already have 2 iron ingots, which is more than we need for our lever.  Now, let's think about what we need for our lever: 1. We have 1 cobblestone (needed for the lever) 2. We need 1 stick, which requires 2 oak planks to craft (we have 1 oak plank, need 1 more)  The opponent doesn't have oak planks, but they might be willing to trade for something else that could help us. Let's check if there are other ways to craft sticks.  I noticed the opponent has cobblestone. Let's see if there's anything useful we can craft with more cobblestone.

However, we could trade for resources that might be valuable for future crafting or trading.  Since we have 1 raw_iron and the opponent has 1 raw_iron, I'll propose trading 1 of our raw_copper for their raw_iron. This would give us 2 raw_iron, which we could potentially smelt into another iron ingot if needed.  My proposal looks good now.

Looking at player 1's inventory, they have iron nuggets which could be useful for crafting other items. I could offer some of my raw copper in exchange for some iron nuggets.
- I see that 9 iron nuggets can be crafted into 1 iron ingot. Since player 1 has 9 iron nuggets, they might be planning to craft an additional iron ingot.  Let me make a proposal that benefits both of us. I'll offer 1 raw copper in exchange for 3 iron nuggets. This way, I get some iron nuggets which could be useful later, and player 1 still has enough to craft an iron ingot if they want (they'll have 6 left plus the 1 they already have).

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:

player 2 checked the item info of craft: **stick**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I now understand that to craft a lever, we need 1 cobblestone and 1 stick. We already have 1 cobblestone in our hand. To make a stick, we need planks. We currently have oak_planks in our hand, which we can use to craft sticks (2 planks = 4 sticks).  Looking at our current hand: - minecraft:cobblestone: 1 - minecraft:iron_ingot: 2 - minecraft:oak_planks: 1 - minecraft:raw_copper: 2 - minecraft:raw_iron: 1  And player 1's hand: - minecraft:cobblestone: 1 - minecraft:iron_ingot: 1 - minecraft:iron_nugget: 9 - minecraft:raw_copper: 1 - minecraft:raw_iron: 1  We need to craft a stick using our oak_planks, but we only have 1 oak_plank and we need 2 to craft sticks. So we need to either get another plank or trade for sticks directly.  Looking at what player 1 has, they don't have planks or sticks. But they do have raw_copper and raw_iron which might be valuable for them. We could offer some of our raw materials in exchange for something that might help us later, or we could try to get more raw_iron to smelt into iron_ingots for other crafting needs.  Let me make a proposal where we offer some of our raw_copper (which we have 2 of) in exchange for their raw_iron. This would give us more raw_iron which we can smelt into iron_ingots later if needed.

I don't have coal, but perhaps he'll accept a larger quantity of iron nuggets as a substitute for fuel, even if it's not ideal.
- Double-checking the chain recipe to be absolutely sure.  I also need to see what I can make with my current resources in case the trade falls through, which is looking increasingly likely.
- I'll offer a significant amount of iron nuggets, hoping he'll see the value in being able to smelt his raw iron, even if it's not a perfect fuel substitute.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I need 2 iron ingots to craft a chain. I currently have 2 iron ingots. I don't need anything else from player 2.  I can offer my raw copper and raw iron since I don't need them for the chain. Maybe player 2 needs them.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- This is an interesting proposal. Player 1 is offering me raw materials without asking for anything in return. Let me analyze this situation:  1. My target item is a lever. Let me check what I need to craft a lever. 2. I currently have: - minecraft:cobblestone: 1 - minecraft:iron_ingot: 2 - minecraft:oak_planks: 1 - minecraft:raw_copper: 2 - minecraft:raw_iron: 1 3. Player 1 is offering me more raw materials (raw_copper and raw_iron) without asking for anything in return. 4. I need to determine if these additional materials help me craft a lever.  Let me first check the recipe for a lever.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **lever**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- Now I understand what I need to craft a lever. The recipe requires: - 1 cobblestone - 1 stick  Looking at my current inventory: - I already have 1 cobblestone - I don't have any sticks, but I do have oak_planks which can be used to craft sticks  Let me check the recipe for sticks to confirm:

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- Now I understand what I need to craft a lever. The recipe requires: - 1 cobblestone - 1 stick  Looking at my current inventory: - I already have 1 cobblestone - I don't have any sticks, but I do have oak_planks which can be used to craft sticks  From the recipe information, I can see that 2 planks can be crafted into 4 sticks. I have 1 oak_planks, which means I can craft 2 sticks. This is enough for the lever.  So my path to crafting a lever is: 1. Use my oak_planks to craft sticks 2. Use 1 stick and my cobblestone to craft a lever  Player 1 is offering me raw_copper: 1 and raw_iron: 1 for free. These materials aren't directly needed for my lever, but: - Having extra materials is generally beneficial - There's no downside to accepting free resources - These materials might be useful for trading in future turns  Player 1 mentioned they have enough materials to craft their target item. This suggests they don't need these materials anymore and are genuinely offering them as a goodwill gesture.  Since there's no cost to me and only potential benefit, I should accept this proposal.

I just traded away my raw materials, which was probably a mistake. I should try to get some iron nuggets or raw iron back.
- I need to review how to make a chain and what other recipes I can make with my current items.
- Based on the possible recipes and the items Player 2 has, I should try to trade for raw iron.  <current status>

- Let me check what sticks are and how to craft them, as they're likely needed for a lever.
- I should also check what I can do with oak planks since I have them in my hand.
- I think I have a good plan.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a chain. I have 2 iron ingots and 1 cobblestone.  Player 2 has 2 iron ingots, 1 cobblestone, 3 raw copper, and 1 oak planks. I need 2 iron ingots and 1 iron nugget to craft a chain. I'm short one iron nugget.  Trading away my raw materials last turn put me in a difficult position.
- I need to confirm the chain recipe and explore other crafting options with my current materials.  I also need to consider what Player 2 might be crafting.  He has enough iron for shears or an iron sword, and the raw copper could be for a spyglass or lightning rod.
- My options are limited without more raw materials.  I need to prioritize getting an iron nugget or the materials to make one.  Trading for raw iron is still the best approach.  Since my last offer was rejected, I need to sweeten the deal.  <current status>
- I will offer Player 2 1 iron ingot AND the cobblestone for 2 raw iron. This is a significant offer, but getting the chain is paramount. If that fails, I'll have to hope he's willing to trade for just the cobblestone next turn.

I'm short one iron nugget.  Trading away my raw materials last turn put me in a difficult position.  I need to acquire an iron nugget or the materials to craft one (9 iron nuggets from 1 iron ingot).

He has enough iron for shears or an iron sword, and the raw copper could be for a spyglass or lightning rod.  He might also be trying for a chain.
- My options are limited without more raw materials.  I need to prioritize getting an iron nugget or raw iron.  Since my previous offers were rejected, I need to make a more appealing trade.  Perhaps offering both cobblestone and an iron ingot for a single iron ingot from him would be beneficial, as it would give him more materials while also giving me a chance to get iron nuggets.  <current status>

- I need to confirm the chain recipe.  It requires 2 iron ingots and 1 iron nugget.  I'm still missing the iron nugget.
- My crafting options are extremely limited. I can't make anything useful with what I have. I need to focus on acquiring either an iron nugget directly or enough raw iron to make one.  Since Player 2 has consistently rejected my offers, I need to try a different approach.  Perhaps he needs the cobblestone for something. I'll try offering it for a single raw iron, and if that fails, I'll offer both my iron ingots for his two, plus the cobblestone.  It's a risky move, but I'm running out of options.  <current status>

- Confirming the chain recipe: 2 iron ingots and 1 iron nugget.
- I can't craft anything useful with my current hand.  I need to acquire an iron nugget or the raw materials to make one.  Since direct trades for raw iron haven't worked, I need to consider what Player 2 might want. He hasn't used his raw copper, so maybe he's not interested in more raw materials.  He also has oak planks, which suggests he might be aiming for wooden tools or decorative items.  Offering him my cobblestone might be more appealing now, especially if he's considering crafting stone tools.  <current status>

## 🌀 Turn 6 start!
----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- First, I need to understand what items I need to craft a lever, which is my target item. Let me check the recipe for a lever.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **lever**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I see that to craft a lever, I need 1 cobblestone and 1 stick. I already have 1 cobblestone in my hand, so I just need a stick. Let me check how to craft a stick.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **stick**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I need to craft a lever, which requires 1 cobblestone and 1 stick. I already have the cobblestone, but I need to craft a stick. Sticks are crafted from planks, and I already have oak_planks in my inventory. Looking at player 1's inventory, they have cobblestone and iron_ingot, but nothing that directly helps me craft a lever.  Since I already have all the materials I need to craft my target item (lever), I don't necessarily need to trade for anything specific. However, it might be good to propose a trade that helps build goodwill with player 1, or that might help me in case I need backup materials.  Looking at what player 1 has and what I could offer, I could propose a trade where I offer some of my raw materials (like raw_copper or raw_iron) that I have in abundance, in exchange for something simple from player 1. This would be a goodwill gesture and might make future trades easier if needed.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:cobblestone * 1, ], offer [minecraft:raw_copper * 1, ] together with a text message: I notice you have some cobblestone that could be useful for my crafting plans. I'm willing to trade one of my raw copper for it. This trade should benefit both of us as we work toward our respective goals. What do you think?


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a chain, which requires 2 iron ingots and 1 raw copper. I already have 2 iron ingots.  Getting raw copper from player 2 would be beneficial for me.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Sounds good. I'll trade my cobblestone for your raw copper.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a chain. I have 2 iron ingots and 1 raw copper. Player 2 has 2 cobblestone, 2 iron ingots, 1 oak planks, 2 raw copper, and 2 raw iron.  I need to get more iron ingots to craft a chain.
- I need 2 iron ingots and 1 raw copper to make a chain. I have enough iron ingots, but I need one more raw copper. Player 2 has 2 raw copper. I can try to trade for one.  <current status>
- I can offer Player 2 my cobblestone for one of his raw copper. He might accept this trade since he has already shown interest in cobblestone in previous turns.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a chain. I have 2 iron ingots. Player 2 has 2 cobblestone, 2 iron ingots, 1 oak planks, 2 raw copper, and 2 raw iron. I need 2 iron ingots and 1 raw copper to craft a chain. I have enough iron ingots, but I need raw copper.
- I need to acquire raw copper.  Player 2 has some, so trading is the most direct route.  I previously offered raw materials for it, which he accepted. Perhaps offering something crafted, even if of lesser value, might be more appealing this time.  He also previously expressed interest in cobblestone. I no longer have cobblestone.  <current status>
- I can offer one iron ingot for one raw copper. This is a fair trade in terms of base materials, and it gives him something directly usable.  If he refuses, I'll have to consider offering both iron ingots for the raw copper, though that puts me at risk if he's also trying for a chain.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- First, I need to understand what a lever is and how to craft it. Let me check the recipe for a lever.
- While waiting for the lever recipe information, let me also check what recipes are possible with our current hand.
- Now I need to understand what items we have and what we need for a lever. Let me analyze the current game state:  Our target: 1 lever Our current hand: - minecraft:cobblestone: 2 - minecraft:iron_ingot: 2 - minecraft:oak_planks: 1 - minecraft:raw_copper: 2 - minecraft:raw_iron: 2  Opponent's hand: - minecraft:iron_ingot: 2  Let me check if we have the necessary items to craft a lever or what we're missing.
- I need to understand all the components needed for crafting a lever. Let me check the recipe for sticks since they're likely needed.
- Based on Minecraft crafting knowledge, a lever typically requires: 1. A stick 2. A cobblestone  We currently have: - 2 cobblestone (sufficient) - 1 oak_planks (can be used to craft sticks)  To craft sticks, we typically need planks. Let me verify the exact recipe.
- Let me check what recipes we can make with our current items while waiting for the stick recipe.
- I need to make sure I understand the lever recipe correctly.
- I think I have a good plan.

- My target is a chain. I have 18 iron nuggets and 1 raw copper.  Player 2 has 2 cobblestone, 2 iron ingots, 1 oak planks, 2 raw copper, and 2 raw iron. I need iron ingots to make a chain.  I can make iron ingots from raw iron, but I don't have enough.  Player 2 has some raw iron, so I could try to trade for it.
- I need to review how to craft a chain.  The item_info tool will tell me what I need.  <current status>
- Let's see... based on the item_info for "chain", I need 2 iron ingots and 1 raw copper. I have the raw copper, but only enough nuggets for 2 iron ingots. I just traded away my raw iron.  I need to get more iron ingots or raw iron from Player 2.
- Player 2 might be trying to make shears or something else requiring iron ingots.  Maybe I can offer him something he needs in exchange for raw iron or iron ingots. He has oak planks, so he might be working towards something wooden.  I don't have anything wooden to offer.
- I could try offering him my raw copper, since he has some, but not a lot.  Maybe he needs more for something.  Or I could offer him my nuggets, but those are valuable to me for making iron ingots.
- My best bet is probably to try and trade for raw iron.  I'll offer him my raw copper for one of his raw iron.  If that doesn't work, I'll try offering more nuggets.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **stick**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I need to craft a lever, which requires 1 cobblestone and 1 stick. I already have 2 cobblestone, but I need to craft sticks. Sticks can be crafted from planks, and I have 1 oak_planks. From the recipe, 2 planks can make 4 sticks, so I have enough planks to make sticks.  Looking at player 1's inventory, they have: - minecraft:iron_ingot: 2 - minecraft:raw_copper: 1  And I have: - minecraft:cobblestone: 2 - minecraft:iron_ingot: 2 - minecraft:oak_planks: 1 - minecraft:raw_copper: 2 - minecraft:raw_iron: 2  I don't really need anything from player 1 to craft my lever, since I already have all the necessary materials. However, I could propose a trade to maintain good relations or to potentially get items that might be useful for future crafting.  Since player 1 has been trying to get iron ingots in previous turns, I could offer one of my raw_iron in exchange for their raw_copper. This would give me more raw_copper which could be useful later, and give them raw_iron which they might need.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a chain. I have 2 iron ingots and 1 raw iron.  Player 2 has 2 iron ingots, 1 raw iron, 3 raw copper, 2 cobblestone, and an oak button. I need more iron.
- I need to review how to make a chain.  The last trade for raw copper didn't help, as I traded away nuggets I could have turned into ingots. I need to focus on getting iron.  <current status>
- I need at least 2 more iron ingots to make a chain.  Trading for Player 2's raw iron would be helpful.  I could offer my raw copper since I don't need it for my target.
- I'll try trading my raw copper for his raw iron again. If that fails, I'll try offering both my raw copper and cobblestone for one of his iron ingots.

- My target is a chain. I have 2 iron ingots and 1 raw iron. Player 2 has 2 iron ingots, 1 raw iron, 3 raw copper, 2 cobblestone, and an oak button. I need 2 more iron ingots.  My previous trades haven't been very successful.  I need to be more strategic.
- I need a total of 4 iron ingots.  I have 2 and 1 raw iron, so if I can get 1 more iron ingot or 1 more raw iron, I can craft the chain.  Player 2 has both.  I need to make a trade that's enticing to him.
- Perhaps offering both my current iron ingots for his 2 iron ingots and his raw iron would be a good deal for me. It might seem like a bad deal for him at first glance, but if he thinks I'm desperate for iron, he might think I'm crafting something else and not realize I'm going for the chain. This would give me enough iron to craft the chain immediately.  It's a risky move, but it could pay off.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- First, I need to understand what a lever is and how to craft it. Let me check the recipe.
- Now I need to see what recipes I can make with my current hand.
- Let me check what an oak button is, since I have one in my hand.
- I need to understand the relationship between oak planks and oak button.
- I think I have a good plan.

- I need a total of 4 iron ingots.  I have 2 and 1 raw iron, so if I can get 1 more iron ingot or 1 more raw iron, I can craft the chain.  Player 2 has both.  I could try offering something less suspicious.  Maybe just trade for a single iron ingot or raw iron.
- I'll offer my raw iron for his raw iron.  It's a neutral trade for him, so he might accept. If that fails, I'll offer my raw iron for a single iron ingot.  It's a slight advantage for him, but it gets me what I need.

I could try offering something less suspicious.  Maybe just trade for a single iron ingot or raw iron.  Since he rejected raw copper for raw iron, maybe I should offer something more valuable, like an iron ingot for his raw iron.

If that's rejected, I'll try offering something slightly more advantageous for him - an iron ingot for his raw iron.  If that fails, I might have to offer a bigger trade, but I want to avoid that if possible.
