### üñ• Server Event: `server__private_start_info`
player 1 enters the game with a private target: [minecraft:lever * 1, ]



## üåÄ Turn 1 start!
----------------------------------------

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a chain.  I need iron ingots and I already have one. My opponent has a lot of raw iron. I should try to trade for some of that. I also want to disguise my intentions, so I'll request some cobblestone as well.  I'll offer them cherry planks, which are less useful to me.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **chain**.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- I need two iron ingots or one iron ingot and two iron nuggets to make a chain.  Since my opponent has raw iron, I'll request two raw iron in exchange for my cherry planks and some coal as fuel.  This will hopefully allow me to craft two iron ingots next turn.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:cherry_planks * 1, minecraft:coal * 1, ] together with a text message: I need some raw iron and you seem to have plenty.  I'm offering you some wood and coal in return.  Let's make a deal!


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a lever.  A lever requires a stick and cobblestone. I already have cobblestone.  Sticks can be crafted from planks.  This trade offers cherry planks, which I can use to make sticks.  They are also asking for raw iron, which I need to smelt into iron ingots to craft a lever.  However, I have a decent amount of raw iron.  The coal is also helpful for smelting the iron.  This trade seems beneficial to me.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1 decided to Accept the proposal with a text message: Sounds good.  Thanks!


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a lever. I need a stick and cobblestone. I have cobblestone, but I need a stick.  Sticks are crafted from planks, and I have one oak plank.  My opponent offered a trade of coal and cherry planks for some of my raw iron. While I don't need the coal right now, the cherry planks could be used to make more sticks if needed.  I'll keep that in mind.  For now, I'll craft a stick from my oak plank.
- I'm checking what I can craft from my current hand.  Hopefully, the output confirms I can make a stick.  <current status>
- Assuming the `possible_recipes_from_hand` confirms I can craft a stick, I will proceed with that craft. Then, since I have both a stick and cobblestone, I will craft the lever.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is 1 chain. I have cherry planks, coal, cobblestone, iron ingot, and raw copper. My opponent has cobblestone, oak planks, raw copper, and raw iron.  I need to figure out how to craft a chain.
- Now I know how to craft a chain. I need 2 iron ingots and 1 iron nuggets. I have 1 iron ingot, so I need 1 more iron ingot and 1 iron nugget. I can smelt raw iron into iron ingots. My opponent has 5 raw iron. I could try to trade for some.  I also need to figure out how to make iron nuggets.
- I can craft an iron nugget from an iron ingot. So, in total, I need 2 iron ingots. I have one, and my opponent has enough raw iron to make several.  I'll try to trade my raw copper for 2 of their raw iron. If they accept, I can craft the chain next turn. If not, I'll need to rethink my strategy.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a lever. I need a stick and cobblestone. I have cobblestone, but I need a stick.  Sticks are crafted from planks, and I have one oak plank.  My opponent offered a trade of coal and cherry planks for some of my raw iron. While I don't need the coal right now, the cherry planks could be useful for more sticks later if I mess up the lever craft somehow. I'll keep that in mind.  For now, I'll check if I can craft a stick from my oak plank.
- Checking what I can craft from my current hand.  I should be able to make a stick.  <current status>
- Assuming the `possible_recipes_from_hand` confirms I can make sticks, I will craft them. Then, with both a stick and cobblestone, I will craft the lever.  I'll need to be careful with the stick crafting to make sure I don't use up all 4 sticks if the recipe produces that many. I only need one for the lever.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a lever. I need a stick and cobblestone. I have the cobblestone. I need to craft a stick from planks. I have one oak plank. This should be enough to craft the lever.  My opponent offered coal and cherry planks for raw iron. I don't need those right now, but the cherry planks could be useful for more sticks later if I need them.
- I'm checking what I can craft to make sure I can make a stick.  <current status>
- Assuming I can craft sticks (4) from my oak plank, I will craft them. Then, with both a stick and cobblestone, I will craft the lever.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is 1 chain. I have cherry planks, coal, cobblestone, iron ingot, and raw copper. My opponent has cobblestone, oak planks, raw copper, and raw iron.  I need to figure out how to craft a chain.
- I need 2 iron ingots and 1 iron nugget to make a chain. I have 1 iron ingot and 1 raw copper.  My opponent has 5 raw iron, 2 raw copper, oak planks, and cobblestone.  They have enough raw iron to make multiple iron ingots.  Trading for raw iron seems like the best approach.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a lever.  To craft a lever, I need one stick and one cobblestone. I already have the cobblestone. I need to craft a stick, which requires planks. I have one oak plank.
- I'm checking the available crafting recipes to confirm I can make a stick from my oak plank.  <current status>
- Assuming the `possible_recipes_from_hand` action confirms I can craft sticks, I will proceed with that craft.  Then, I will craft the lever using the stick and cobblestone.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a lever. I need one stick and one cobblestone. I have the cobblestone. I need to craft a stick, which requires planks. I have one oak plank, which is sufficient.
- Checking available crafting recipes to confirm I can craft sticks from my oak plank.  <current status>
- Assuming `possible_recipes_from_hand` confirms I can craft sticks, I'll create 4 sticks from the oak plank, then use one stick and the cobblestone to craft the lever.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is 1 chain. I have cherry planks, coal, cobblestone, iron ingot, and raw copper. My opponent has cobblestone, oak planks, raw copper, and raw iron.  I need to figure out how to craft a chain.
- I need 2 iron ingots and 1 iron nugget to make a chain. I have 1 iron ingot and 1 raw copper.  My opponent has 5 raw iron, 2 raw copper, oak planks, and cobblestone.  They have enough raw iron to make multiple iron ingots.  Trading for raw iron seems like the best approach.  I'll start by offering my raw copper for 2 raw iron. If that fails, I'll offer my coal for 2 raw iron.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

## üåÄ Turn 2 start!
----------------------------------------

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I need a lever.  Levers require a stick and cobblestone. I have cobblestone, but I need sticks. Sticks are crafted from planks. I have oak planks, which will work.  My opponent has cherry planks and cobblestone as well as iron and copper ingots.  I should try to get some more cobblestone from them, just in case I mess up crafting the lever. I'll offer them raw iron, which they tried to get from me last turn. I don't want to give them too much, though, as they could use it to craft more iron ingots, which could be used for other things.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **lever**.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My plan is to craft a lever using my existing cobblestone and oak planks.  I'll offer some raw iron for additional cobblestone, as a backup.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:cobblestone * 1, ], offer [minecraft:raw_iron * 1, ] together with a text message: I'm looking for some extra cobblestone.  I have some raw iron I'm willing to trade.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a chain.  Let's see what I can make with cobblestone and raw iron.  A chain requires 2 iron ingots and 1 iron nugget.  I already have 1 iron ingot.  Trading cobblestone for raw iron could help me get another iron ingot, which moves me closer to my goal. Cobblestone is relatively easy to acquire, while raw iron is more valuable to me right now.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **chain**.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- Confirming that a chain requires 2 iron ingots and 1 iron nugget. I have one iron ingot, so getting raw iron to smelt into another ingot is helpful.  I'll accept the trade.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Thanks for the trade!


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a lever. I need a stick and a cobblestone. I have 2 cobblestone and 1 oak planks. I can craft sticks from oak planks.  My opponent has raw iron, iron ingot, copper ingot, and cherry planks.  They tried to trade for my raw iron last turn, offering cherry planks and coal.  I accepted their offer of cobblestone for raw iron this turn. I need to craft a stick.
- Let's see what I can craft with what I have.  I should be able to make sticks from the oak planks. Then I can make the lever.  <current status>
- I have enough materials to craft a lever now. I should craft it and win the game.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a chain. I need 2 iron ingots and 1 raw iron to craft it. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 1 raw iron. I need 1 more iron ingot.  My opponent has 4 raw iron. I could try to trade for some raw iron to smelt into an iron ingot. I also have a cherry plank and a copper ingot, which are not useful for my target. I could trade these if my opponent wants them.
- I should check what recipes are available to me right now.
- I should also check the recipes for iron ingots.
- Based on my opponent's trades and current hand, they might be trying to craft stone tools. They have cobblestone, oak planks (which can be crafted into sticks), and raw iron.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a lever. I need a stick and a cobblestone. I have 2 cobblestone and 1 oak planks. I can craft sticks from oak planks.  My opponent has raw iron, iron ingot, copper ingot, and cherry planks.  They tried to trade for my raw iron last turn, offering cherry planks and coal. I rejected that. Then I offered them cobblestone for raw iron, which they accepted.
- I should be able to see the recipe for sticks from planks, and then the recipe for a lever.  <current status>
- I have everything I need to make a lever.  I'll craft the stick, then the lever.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a lever. I need one stick and one cobblestone. I have 2 cobblestone and 1 oak plank. I can craft sticks from the oak plank. My opponent has raw iron, iron ingot, copper ingot, and cherry planks.  They tried to trade for my raw iron last turn, but I rejected it. This turn, I traded cobblestone for raw iron.
- I should be able to craft sticks from the oak planks, and then craft the lever using a stick and a cobblestone.  <current status>

I could try to trade for some raw iron to smelt into an iron ingot. I also have a cherry plank and a copper ingot, which are not directly useful for my target. I could trade these if my opponent wants them.  They traded for cobblestone earlier, suggesting they might need it for tools or a furnace.
- I need to see what I can craft with what I have and what I might be able to get.  Knowing the recipes for iron ingots will also be helpful.

## üåÄ Turn 3 start!
----------------------------------------

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- I need 2 iron ingots and 1 chain to craft my target. I currently have 2 iron ingots.  My opponent has raw iron and raw copper.  I could try to trade my copper ingot for more raw iron, which they seem to be collecting, and then craft it into an iron ingot.  I won't offer iron ingots as that gets them closer to crafting chainmail, which uses iron.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **chain**.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- I'll offer my copper ingot for 2 raw iron.  This will let me craft another iron ingot, getting me closer to my goal.  It also gives my opponent more raw materials, but not the specific ones they need for chainmail.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:copper_ingot * 1, ] together with a text message: I have an extra copper ingot I'm willing to trade for some raw iron.  Let me know if you're interested.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a lever, which requires a stick and cobblestone. I have the cobblestone, but need sticks, which are crafted from planks.  I already have oak planks, so I could craft sticks.  Raw iron is needed to make an iron ingot, which can be used to make many useful items, including shears (which require iron ingots and planks). Copper ingots are useful for making spyglasses, which don't seem relevant to my goal.  Trading away raw iron might hinder my ability to craft other useful items later.  However, I have a decent amount of raw iron, and getting a copper ingot could be useful for distracting my opponent or potentially crafting something unexpected later.
