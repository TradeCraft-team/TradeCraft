player 1 enters the game with a private target: [minecraft:lever * 1, ]



## üåÄ Turn 1 start!
----------------------------------------

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a bucket, which requires iron ingots. I already have one iron ingot.  My opponent has a lot of raw iron, which they could smelt into iron ingots. I'll try to trade for some of their raw iron. I also need fuel for smelting, and I have coal, which is a good fuel source.  I'll offer some of my less useful items like cherry planks and cobblestone in exchange. I want to disguise my need for iron, so I'll also request some raw copper, even though I don't need it right now. This might make them think I'm trying to craft something involving copper.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **bucket**.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- I need 3 iron ingots for a bucket, and I already have one.  I'll try to get 2 raw iron from my opponent by offering cherry planks and cobblestone.  I'll also request raw copper to make them think I'm pursuing a copper-related crafting path.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:raw_copper * 1, minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:cherry_planks * 1, minecraft:cobblestone * 1, ] together with a text message: I'm looking to work with copper.  Would you be willing to trade some raw iron and copper for these planks and cobblestone?


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a lever.  A lever requires a cobblestone and a stick. I already have a cobblestone. Sticks are crafted from planks.  This trade offers me cherry planks and another cobblestone. If I accept, I'll have enough materials to craft a lever.  However, player 2 says they are "looking to work with copper".  Giving them more copper might help them achieve their goal, whatever it is. I need to consider if giving them copper is worth getting the cherry planks. I have enough raw iron, so giving that away isn't a big deal.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **lever**.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- The item_info confirms that I can craft a lever with the materials offered in the trade.  Giving away the raw copper might be risky, but I'll have everything I need to complete my goal.  I'll accept the trade.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Sounds good. I'm interested in working with wood.


### üñ• Server Event: `server__update_all_hands`
Server updated all hands:
player 2 hand: [minecraft:coal * 1, minecraft:iron_ingot * 1, minecraft:raw_copper * 2, minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ]
player 1 hand: [minecraft:cherry_planks * 1, minecraft:cobblestone * 2, minecraft:oak_planks * 1, minecraft:raw_copper * 1, minecraft:raw_iron * 3, ]


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a lever.  I need a stick and cobblestone. I have 2 cobblestone, so I need a stick.  Sticks are made from planks, and I have 1 cherry plank and 1 oak plank.  I traded some raw materials for the cherry plank last turn. My opponent seems interested in raw copper and iron.
- I can make a stick from either plank.
- I'll see what recipes are available to me.  Then I'll make a stick and then the lever.  <current status>
- Based on the available recipes, I will craft a stick using my oak plank.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket, which requires 3 iron ingots. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron.  My opponent has 3 raw iron. I need to obtain at least 1 more raw iron from them to be able to craft a bucket this turn. I also have coal, which they might need for smelting. I should try to trade for their raw iron.
- I need to confirm the recipe for a bucket.  <current status>
- I will offer them coal in exchange for raw iron.  Since they accepted a trade for wood earlier, they might be trying to craft something wooden. Offering coal might incentivize them to smelt more iron.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a lever. I need a stick and cobblestone. I have 2 cobblestone, so I just need a stick. Sticks are made from planks, and I have 1 cherry plank and 1 oak plank. I traded some raw materials for the cherry plank last turn. My opponent seems interested in raw copper and iron, which I still have a decent amount of.
- I'll check the possible recipes to confirm I can make a stick and then the lever.  I also want to see if there's anything else I could be making that might be useful or throw my opponent off.  <current status>
- I will craft a stick using one of my planks. Since both types of planks produce 4 sticks, I'll use the oak plank and save the cherry plank in case I need it for something else later.  Then I'll craft the lever.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket, which requires 3 iron ingots. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron.  My opponent has 5 raw iron. I need to obtain at least 1 more raw iron from them to be able to craft a bucket this turn. I also have coal, which they might need for smelting. I should try to trade for their raw iron. I traded my wood earlier, which might have suggested I don't need it, so they might be less inclined to trade for it now.
- I need to confirm the recipe for a bucket and how much iron I need exactly.  <current status>
- I will offer them coal in exchange for 2 raw iron.  This will give me enough to craft a bucket this turn. Since they have a fair amount of raw iron, they might be willing to part with some of it for fuel.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a lever. I need a stick and a cobblestone. I have 2 cobblestone, so I just need a stick. Sticks are made from planks, and I have 1 cherry plank and 1 oak plank.  I can craft the lever this turn. My opponent seems interested in raw copper and iron. I have some left, so I could use that in future trades if necessary.
- I'll use the oak plank to make sticks, then use a stick and a cobblestone to make the lever.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:

- I will offer them coal in exchange for 2 raw iron.  This will give me enough to craft a bucket this turn. Since they have a fair amount of raw iron, they might be willing to part with some of it for fuel.  If they refuse, I'll try offering coal for 1 raw iron.

I can craft the lever this turn. My opponent seems interested in raw copper and iron. I have some left, so I could use that in future trades if necessary.
- I will use the oak planks to craft sticks, then use a stick and cobblestone to craft the lever. This completes my objective.
