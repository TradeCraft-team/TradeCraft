player 2 enters the game with a private target: [minecraft:lever * 1, ]



## 🌀 Turn 1 start!
----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a bucket.  I need iron ingots for that. I already have one iron ingot. My opponent has a lot of raw iron. I should try to trade for some of that raw iron. I also need fuel for smelting the raw iron. I have coal, which is a good fuel source.  I'll offer some of my less useful items like cherry planks and cobblestone in exchange for the raw iron.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **bucket**.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I need 3 iron ingots total, and I already have one.  I'll ask for 2 raw iron from my opponent.  Since they have 5, this seems like a reasonable request.  I'll offer them my cherry planks and cobblestone, which aren't directly useful to me right now.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:cherry_planks * 1, minecraft:cobblestone * 1, ] together with a text message: I'm looking to craft some tools.  Would you be willing to trade some raw iron for these planks and cobblestone?


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a lever.  A lever requires a cobblestone and a stick. I already have one cobblestone.  Sticks can be crafted from planks.  This trade offers me another cobblestone and cherry planks.  While I don't need another cobblestone, the cherry planks would allow me to craft sticks.  I have plenty of raw iron, and they likely need it for tools or armor.  This trade seems beneficial to me.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Sounds good.  I could use the planks.

- My target is a lever.  I need a stick and cobblestone. I have 2 cobblestone and need a stick.  Sticks are crafted from planks. I have 1 oak plank and 1 cherry plank.  I can make sticks. My opponent traded for iron, likely to make an iron pickaxe.

- I have enough planks to make sticks, and I have the cobblestone. I should be able to craft the lever now.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket, which requires 3 iron ingots. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron.  My opponent has 3 raw iron. I need to obtain 2 more raw iron from them to craft another 2 iron ingots. I'll offer them my raw copper in exchange.

- I'll review the possible recipes and choose the best one for crafting sticks. Then I'll craft the lever.  <current status>
