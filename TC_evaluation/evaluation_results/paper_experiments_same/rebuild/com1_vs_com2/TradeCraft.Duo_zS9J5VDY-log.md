## 🌀 Turn 1 start!
----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a bucket, which requires iron ingots. I already have one iron ingot.  My opponent has a lot of raw iron, which they could smelt into iron ingots. I'll try to trade for some of their raw iron. I also need fuel for smelting, so coal would be helpful. I'll offer them some of my less useful items in exchange.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **bucket**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I need two more iron ingots.  I'll offer my cherry planks and cobblestone for 2 raw iron.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:cherry_planks * 1, minecraft:cobblestone * 1, ] together with a text message: I'll trade you these planks and cobblestone for some of your raw iron.  I need to build some things.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a stone_shovel.  I need cobblestone and sticks.  I already have one cobblestone.  Sticks are crafted from planks.  This trade offers me one cobblestone and one cherry_planks.  Getting the cherry_planks would allow me to craft sticks.  Giving up two raw iron doesn't seem to hurt my plan, as I don't need it for the shovel.  This trade seems beneficial.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Sounds good.  I could use the planks and cobblestone.


### 🖥 Server Event: `server__update_all_hands`
Server updated all hands:
player 2 hand: [minecraft:coal * 1, minecraft:iron_ingot * 1, minecraft:raw_copper * 1, minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ]
player 1 hand: [minecraft:cherry_planks * 1, minecraft:cobblestone * 2, minecraft:oak_planks * 1, minecraft:raw_copper * 2, minecraft:raw_iron * 3, ]


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I need cobblestone and sticks. I have enough cobblestone.  I need to craft sticks. Sticks require planks. I have both oak and cherry planks.  My opponent has coal and iron ingot, which I don't immediately need.  They traded for raw iron, which suggests they might be trying to make iron tools or armor.
- Let's see what I can craft with what I have. I should prioritize making sticks.  <current status>
- I have enough planks to make sticks. I'll make 2 sticks, which is enough for a shovel.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I need cobblestone and sticks. I have 2 cobblestone.  I need to craft sticks. Sticks require planks. I have both 1 oak and 1 cherry planks. I'll use the oak planks. My opponent has coal and iron ingot, which I don't immediately need.  They traded for raw iron, which suggests they might be trying to make iron tools or armor.
- I can craft sticks using my oak planks. I'll craft 4 sticks, which is more than enough for a shovel, but it's good to have extra. Then I can craft the stone_shovel.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket, which requires 3 iron ingots. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron.  My opponent has 3 raw iron. I need to obtain 2 more raw iron from them to craft another 2 iron ingots. I traded away my planks and cobblestone in the last turn, which might have been a mistake as they could have been used as fuel. I need to consider how to smelt the raw iron into iron ingots.
- I need to check the recipe for iron ingots and see what fuel sources I can use.  I also need to analyze my opponent's potential target and see if they might need iron.  If they do, I need to be more strategic in my trading.  I should also consider if there are any alternative ways to obtain iron ingots, such as trading directly for them.
- Let's see what I can craft with my current resources. This will help me determine what I need to trade for.  I also need to think about how to disguise my intentions.  Perhaps I can craft something seemingly unrelated to buckets to throw my opponent off.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.
