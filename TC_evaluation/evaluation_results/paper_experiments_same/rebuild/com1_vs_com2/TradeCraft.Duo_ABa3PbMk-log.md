## 🌀 Turn 1 start!
----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft shears, which requires 2 iron ingots. I currently have 1 iron ingot. My opponent has 5 raw iron.  I need to acquire more iron. I can try to trade for some raw iron, then smelt it into iron ingots. I will offer them my coal, as they might need it for smelting, and it's not directly useful for my goal. I'll request 2 raw iron in return.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **shears**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I'll offer my coal in exchange for 2 raw iron. This will allow me to smelt the raw iron into iron ingots, getting me closer to crafting shears.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:coal * 1, ] together with a text message: I have some coal I'm willing to trade. I'm looking for raw iron. Would you be interested in trading 2 raw iron for my coal?


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a torch.  A torch requires a stick and coal. I have no coal currently.  This trade offers me coal. Two raw iron seems like a fair trade for coal at this stage.  I need coal more than I need raw iron right now.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Deal.


### 🖥 Server Event: `server__update_all_hands`

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a torch. I have coal and sticks are needed to craft torches.  I have oak planks which can be crafted into sticks.  My opponent traded coal to me, which is interesting since they could use it to make torches as well. I need to analyze their moves and try to figure out their target.
- I need to confirm the recipe for torches.  <current status>
- Now I have coal and I can craft sticks from oak planks. I should craft sticks and then craft a torch.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is shears, which requires 2 iron ingots. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron.  My opponent has 3 raw iron. I traded my coal for 2 raw iron in the last turn. I need one more iron ingot. I can smelt my raw iron to get another iron ingot. I have coal now.
- I need to smelt my 2 raw iron into 2 iron ingots. This requires a furnace and fuel. I have enough raw iron. I have coal for fuel.
- Confirming the recipe for iron ingot.  <current status>

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a torch. I have the coal needed. I need sticks to craft the torch. I have oak planks which can be crafted into sticks. My opponent traded coal to me, which suggests they might not need it for their target, or they have another source of fuel.  I should prioritize crafting the torch as quickly as possible.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:

Since I only have one oak plank, I can only craft 2 sticks. My opponent traded coal to me, which suggests they might not need it for their target, or they have another source of fuel.  I should prioritize crafting the torch as quickly as possible.
