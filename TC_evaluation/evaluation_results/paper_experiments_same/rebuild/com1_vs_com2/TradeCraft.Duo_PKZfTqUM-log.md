### 🖥 Server Event: `server__private_start_info`
player 1 enters the game with a private target: [minecraft:stone_shovel * 1, ]



## 🌀 Turn 1 start!
----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a chain.  I need iron ingots and I already have one. My opponent has a lot of raw iron. I should try to trade for some of that. I also want to disguise my intentions, so I'll request some cobblestone as well.  I'll offer them cherry planks, which are less useful to me.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **chain**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I need two iron ingots or one iron ingot and two iron nuggets to make a chain.  Since my opponent has raw iron, I'll request two raw iron in exchange for my cherry planks and some coal as fuel.  This will hopefully allow me to craft two iron ingots next turn.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:cherry_planks * 1, minecraft:coal * 1, ] together with a text message: I need some raw iron and you seem to have plenty.  I'm offering you some wood and coal in return.  Let's make a deal!


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a stone_shovel.  I need cobblestone and sticks. I already have cobblestone. Sticks are crafted from planks.  While I have oak planks, more planks could be helpful for fuel or other crafting needs.  Coal is also useful for fuel.  Raw iron is needed to make an iron ingot, but I need a furnace first.  Trading 2 raw iron for cherry planks and coal seems beneficial at this stage.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Deal.


### 🖥 Server Event: `server__update_all_hands`
Server updated all hands:
player 2 hand: [minecraft:cobblestone * 1, minecraft:iron_ingot * 1, minecraft:raw_copper * 1, minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ]
player 1 hand: [minecraft:cherry_planks * 1, minecraft:coal * 1, minecraft:cobblestone * 1, minecraft:oak_planks * 1, minecraft:raw_copper * 2, minecraft:raw_iron * 3, ]


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a chain. I need iron ingots to craft it. I have one iron ingot and two raw iron. I can smelt the raw iron into iron ingots. My opponent has more raw iron, but I don't think they will trade it to me since it's a key ingredient for chains. I need fuel to smelt the raw iron. I have coal.
- I confirmed that I need 2 iron ingots and 1 iron nuggets to craft a chain. I can craft iron nuggets from an iron ingot. I need to smelt my 2 raw iron into iron ingots first.
- I can smelt raw iron using coal as fuel.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I need cobblestone and sticks. I have cobblestone, but I need to craft sticks. Sticks require planks, and I have both oak_planks and cherry_planks. I also have coal and raw materials, but those aren't immediately relevant. My opponent has some raw_iron, an iron_ingot, cobblestone, and raw_copper.  They traded for raw_iron last turn, which suggests they might be aiming for something iron-related.
- Confirming the recipe for stone_shovel and stick.
- I have enough planks to make sticks, and I have the cobblestone. I should prioritize crafting sticks and then the shovel.  I don't need to trade right now.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I need cobblestone and sticks. I have cobblestone, but I need sticks. Sticks require planks, which I have (both oak and cherry).  I received cherry_planks and coal in the last trade, giving up some raw_iron. My opponent might be trying to craft something iron-related, given their trade. I have enough materials to craft the stone_shovel this turn.
- Confirming the recipe for a stone_shovel.
- I think I have a good plan.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a chain. I need 2 iron ingots and 1 iron nugget. I have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron. I also have coal, which I can use as fuel. I need to smelt the raw iron into iron ingots.  I traded away some useful items like planks in the last turn, which might have been a mistake. I should focus on getting more iron. My opponent has a lot of raw iron, but they are unlikely to trade it to me.
- I confirmed the recipes for iron ingots and nuggets. I need to smelt the raw iron first. Then I can craft the nugget and finally the chain.
- I think I have a good plan.

I also have coal and raw materials, but those aren't immediately relevant. My opponent has some raw_iron, an iron_ingot, cobblestone, and raw_copper.  They traded for raw_iron last turn, which suggests they might be aiming for something iron-related, possibly an iron tool or armor. I have enough materials to craft the stone_shovel this turn.
- Confirming the recipe for a stone_shovel and stick.  I want to double-check the exact requirements.
- I think I have a good plan.

## 🌀 Turn 2 start!
----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I need cobblestone to craft sticks and then a stone shovel. I currently have one cobblestone. I'll try to trade for more cobblestone from player 2.  I'll offer them raw copper since I have two and it doesn't seem like they are actively using it. I'll also try to get some coal from them as extra fuel for later crafting if needed.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **stone_shovel**.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I need one more cobblestone.  I'll offer one raw copper for one cobblestone. I'll also request coal in case I need it for the furnace later.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:coal * 1, minecraft:cobblestone * 1, ], offer [minecraft:raw_copper * 1, ] together with a text message: I'm looking for some more cobblestone.  Would you be willing to trade one cobblestone and some coal for some raw copper?


### 🖥 Server Event: `server__proposal_invalid`
player 1's proposal is INVALID according to the game rule.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I need more cobblestone to craft a stone shovel. My opponent has cobblestone and I have excess raw copper. I'll offer some raw copper for cobblestone. I'll also try to get some coal from them, as it could be useful for smelting later.  I need to be careful not to give them anything that would help them craft their unknown target item.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **stone_shovel**.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I need one more cobblestone.  Offering one raw copper for one cobblestone seems like a fair trade. I'll also request coal, as that could be useful later, and they might be willing to part with it.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:coal * 1, minecraft:cobblestone * 1, ], offer [minecraft:raw_copper * 1, ] together with a text message: I have extra raw copper.  I could use some more cobblestone and coal.  Would you be willing to trade?


### 🖥 Server Event: `server__proposal_invalid`
player 1's proposal is INVALID according to the game rule.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I need sticks and cobblestone to make a stone shovel. I have cobblestone, but I need sticks.  Sticks can be crafted from planks, and I have two types of planks. My opponent has cobblestone, which I could use for more complex tools later, but right now I need sticks. I'll try to trade some raw copper for cobblestone. I'll offer a smaller amount of raw copper than last time since they rejected that.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **stick**.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I'll offer one raw copper for one cobblestone.  This keeps my offer reasonable and helps me conserve resources.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:cobblestone * 1, ], offer [minecraft:raw_copper * 1, ] together with a text message: I could use an extra cobblestone. Would you trade one for some raw copper?


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- They want my cobblestone for their raw copper.  I need iron ingots to make a chain, and I already have some raw iron and raw copper.  Getting more raw copper won't hurt, and losing a cobblestone isn't a big deal right now.  It might be a good idea to accept to keep a positive trading relationship and see what they do with the cobblestone.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Sure, sounds good.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I need cobblestone and sticks. I have 2 cobblestone.  I need to craft sticks. Sticks require planks. I have 1 cherry_planks and 1 oak_planks.  I can craft sticks from either.
- Let's see what recipes I can make with my current hand.  I'm particularly interested in stick recipes.  If I can make sticks, I can make the stone shovel.  I also want to see if there's anything else useful I can craft.  The opponent has iron nuggets and raw iron.  They might be trying to make iron ingots, then tools. I should consider trading for more cobblestone if possible.  <current status>
- I have enough cobblestone and planks to craft a stone_shovel.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a chain. I need 2 iron ingots and 1 iron nugget to craft it. I currently have 9 iron nuggets and 2 raw iron. I need to smelt the raw iron into iron ingots.  My opponent has 3 raw iron, 1 raw copper, 2 cobblestone, 1 coal, 1 oak planks, and 1 cherry planks.  They traded me a raw copper for a cobblestone last turn, which suggests they might need copper ingots. They also have coal, which is needed for smelting.
- I need to confirm the chain recipe and see what other recipes use iron ingots or nuggets.  I also want to see if there are any other uses for raw copper, since my opponent seems interested in it.
- Based on the item info, I should be able to smelt my raw iron into ingots. I need fuel for this. I don't have any fuel currently. My opponent has coal, but I don't want to trade for it if I can avoid it. I could try to trade some iron nuggets for their coal.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

- Let's confirm the recipes I can make with my current hand. I should be able to craft sticks and then the stone shovel. I'll check if there's anything else useful I can craft, though I doubt it. The opponent has iron nuggets, raw iron, and raw copper.  They might be trying to make iron ingots, then tools.  I'll keep an eye on their actions.  <current status>

- My target is a chain. I need 2 iron ingots and 1 iron nugget to craft it. I currently have 9 iron nuggets and 2 raw iron. I need to smelt the raw iron into iron ingots.  My opponent has 3 raw iron, 1 raw copper, 2 cobblestone, 1 coal, 1 oak planks, and 1 cherry planks.  They traded me a raw copper for a cobblestone last turn, which suggests they might need copper ingots. They also have coal, which is needed for smelting.  I have 2 raw copper now.
- Confirming the chain recipe.
- Checking what I can do with raw iron and how my opponent can use it.
- Checking uses for raw copper, since I have 2 and my opponent traded for some last turn.
- I think I have a good plan.
