## 🌀 Turn 1 start!
----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a chain.  I need iron ingots for that. I already have one iron ingot. My opponent has a lot of raw iron. I should try to trade for some of that raw iron. I also need fuel for smelting the raw iron. I have coal, which is a good fuel source.  I'll offer some of my less useful items like cherry planks and cobblestone in exchange for the raw iron.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **chain**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I need two iron ingots or one iron ingot and two iron nuggets to craft a chain.  Since my opponent has raw iron, I'll request that.  I'll offer cobblestone and cherry planks, which are less immediately useful to me.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:cherry_planks * 1, minecraft:cobblestone * 1, ] together with a text message: I'm looking for some raw iron.  Would you be willing to trade for these planks and cobblestone?


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I need cobblestone to craft a stone shovel.  I have raw iron that I don't immediately need. This trade gives me an extra cobblestone and some cherry planks. Let me check how to craft a stone shovel.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **stone_shovel**.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I need one cobblestone and two sticks.  This trade gives me the cobblestone I need.  I can get sticks from planks.  This trade seems beneficial.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Deal.
