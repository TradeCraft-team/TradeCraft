## üåÄ Turn 1 start!
----------------------------------------

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I need to acquire iron ingots to craft a bucket.  My opponent has a lot of raw iron. I can offer them coal to smelt it, and request some of the resulting iron ingots in return.  I'll also check the recipe for a bucket to be sure.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **bucket**.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My plan seems sound.  I'll offer coal and request iron ingots.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:iron_ingot * 2, ], offer [minecraft:coal * 1, ] together with a text message: I have coal, and I see you have a lot of raw iron.  I'd be willing to trade my coal for some iron ingots if you're interested.  It would allow you to smelt the raw iron, and I need the ingots for a project.


### üñ• Server Event: `server__proposal_invalid`
player 1's proposal is INVALID according to the game rule.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I need iron ingots to make a bucket. My opponent has raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots. I can offer them coal to smelt the raw iron, and request some of the resulting iron ingots in return.  I'll offer coal and request iron ingots.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **bucket**.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I have 1 coal.  They have 5 raw iron.  It takes 1 coal to smelt 1 raw iron into 1 iron ingot. I need 3 iron ingots for a bucket. I'll offer 1 coal and request 2 iron ingots.
- My proposal looks good now.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:iron_ingot * 2, ], offer [minecraft:coal * 1, ] together with a text message: I have coal, you have raw iron.  I need iron ingots for a bucket.  Let's trade. I'll give you 1 coal for 2 iron ingots.


### üñ• Server Event: `server__proposal_invalid`
player 1's proposal is INVALID according to the game rule.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I need to get an iron ingot to craft a bucket. My opponent has raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots. I can offer them coal to smelt the raw iron. I will ask for one iron ingot in return.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I need 3 iron ingots to make a bucket.  My opponent has raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots. I can offer them coal to smelt the raw iron. I will ask for one iron ingot in return for the coal.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **iron_ingot**.


### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:iron_ingot * 1, ], offer [minecraft:coal * 1, ] together with a text message: I have coal, and you have raw iron. I'll trade you this coal for one iron ingot.  This will allow you to smelt your raw iron. I need the iron ingot to craft something important.


### üñ• Server Event: `server__proposal_invalid`
player 1's proposal is INVALID according to the game rule.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I need three iron ingots to make a bucket. I currently have one iron ingot.  player 2 has five raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots. I can offer them coal to smelt the raw iron, and request some of the resulting iron ingots in return.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **bucket**.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I need three iron ingots to make a bucket. I currently have one iron ingot. player 2 has five raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots. I can offer them coal to smelt the raw iron, and request some of the resulting iron ingots in return. Since they have 5 raw iron, I'll request two iron ingots, leaving them with three.  I'll offer them my coal as fuel for the furnace.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:iron_ingot * 2, ], offer [minecraft:coal * 1, ] together with a text message: I have coal, you have raw iron. I need two iron ingots to craft a bucket.  Would you be willing to smelt your raw iron using my coal and trade me two iron ingots for the coal?


### üñ• Server Event: `server__proposal_invalid`
player 1's proposal is INVALID according to the game rule.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I need iron ingots to craft a bucket.  player 2 has raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots. I can offer them coal, which they can use as fuel for smelting. I'll offer coal in exchange for raw iron.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **bucket**.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I need 3 iron ingots to craft a bucket. player 2 has 5 raw iron, which can be smelted into 5 iron ingots. I can offer them coal, which they can use as fuel for smelting. I'll offer coal in exchange for raw iron.  Since I only have one coal, I'll ask for as much raw iron as I can reasonably expect to get for that amount of coal.
- My proposal looks good now.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I need 3 iron ingots to craft a bucket. player 2 has 5 raw iron, which can be smelted into 5 iron ingots. I can offer them coal, which they can use as fuel for smelting. I'll offer coal in exchange for raw iron.  Since I only have one coal, I'll ask for as much raw iron as I can reasonably expect to get for that amount of coal.  They might need more than one coal to smelt all their raw iron, but two raw iron should be enough for me to get started.
- My proposal looks good now.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [], offer [] together with a text message: Formatting issues repeated multiple times


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- player 1 is offering nothing and requesting nothing. This is likely a stalling tactic or an attempt to communicate something through the lack of a real offer.  The message "Formatting issues repeated multiple times" might be a hint or just frustration with the interface.  Since they aren't asking for anything, accepting doesn't hurt me directly, but it also doesn't help me.  My goal is to get a stone shovel, which requires cobblestone and sticks. I already have cobblestone.  Rejecting might provoke them into a more meaningful offer next turn, or it might confirm to them that I don't have anything they need.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **stick**.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- I have oak planks and cobblestone.  I need sticks. Accepting this trade won't hurt me, and it might make them reveal more information in the next turn.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Thanks!

## üåÄ Turn 2 start!
----------------------------------------

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- I need a stone shovel.  A stone shovel requires sticks and cobblestone. I have cobblestone, but I need sticks. Sticks are crafted from planks. I have oak planks, which will work. My opponent has coal, which I could use for smelting iron into ingots for other tools later.  I'll offer some raw iron for their coal, trying to appear as if I'm aiming for iron tools. This will disguise my true goal of crafting a stone shovel.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **stick**.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My proposal looks good. I'll offer two raw iron for one coal.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:coal * 1, ], offer [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ] together with a text message: I'm working towards iron tools. Would you trade some coal for raw iron?


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is an iron pickaxe.  I need more iron ingots to make that. Two raw iron can be smelted into two iron ingots. This trade seems beneficial for me.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Sounds good. I need the iron.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is `minecraft:iron_chestplate`.  I currently have 3 `minecraft:raw_iron`, 1 `minecraft:coal`, 2 `minecraft:raw_copper`, 1 `minecraft:cobblestone`, and 1 `minecraft:oak_planks`. The opponent has 2 `minecraft:raw_iron`, 1 `minecraft:iron_ingot`, 1 `minecraft:coal`, 1 `minecraft:cobblestone`, 1 `minecraft:raw_copper`, and 1 `minecraft:cherry_planks`. I need to smelt my raw iron into ingots. I also traded away some raw iron last turn, which might have been a mistake. I need to be more careful about what I trade.
- I need to confirm the recipe for the iron chestplate and the iron ingots.
- Okay, I remember now.  I need 8 iron ingots for the chestplate.  And each iron ingot requires 1 raw iron and fuel. I have enough raw iron, but I only have 1 coal. I need more fuel.  My opponent also has coal, but I don't want to trade for it directly, as that would signal my intentions.  I could try to trade for their cherry planks, which can be used as fuel.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is minecraft:iron_pickaxe. I have minecraft:cherry_planks, minecraft:cobblestone, minecraft:iron_ingot, minecraft:raw_copper, and minecraft:raw_iron in hand. The opponent has minecraft:coal, minecraft:cobblestone, minecraft:oak_planks, minecraft:raw_copper, and minecraft:raw_iron.  I need more iron ingots to craft an iron pickaxe. I traded for raw iron last turn, so I can smelt that into iron ingots.
- I need to confirm the recipe for iron pickaxe and how to make iron ingots.
- I can smelt raw iron using a furnace and fuel. I have raw iron, but I traded away my coal last turn. I could try trading for coal again, or I could use my cherry planks as fuel.  Since my opponent seems focused on iron, they might be willing to trade more raw iron for the planks.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is `minecraft:iron_chestplate`. I currently have 3 `minecraft:raw_iron`, 1 `minecraft:coal`, 2 `minecraft:raw_copper`, 1 `minecraft:cobblestone`, and 1 `minecraft:oak_planks`. The opponent has 2 `minecraft:raw_iron`, 1 `minecraft:iron_ingot`, 1 `minecraft:coal`, 1 `minecraft:cobblestone`, 1 `minecraft:raw_copper`, and 1 `minecraft:cherry_planks`. I need to smelt my raw iron into ingots. I offered raw iron last turn, which might have been a mistake if the opponent's target also requires iron. I need to be more strategic about future trades.
- I need 8 iron ingots for the chestplate.
- Each iron ingot requires 1 raw iron and 1/8 of any fuel. I have enough raw iron, but limited fuel. I have 1 coal, which is enough to smelt 8 raw iron.  I could try trading for the opponent's cherry planks for additional fuel, but I need to be careful not to reveal my intentions.  Perhaps offering cobblestone would be less suspicious.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is minecraft:iron_pickaxe. I have minecraft:cherry_planks, minecraft:cobblestone, minecraft:iron_ingot, minecraft:raw_copper, and minecraft:raw_iron in hand. The opponent has minecraft:coal, minecraft:cobblestone, minecraft:oak_planks, minecraft:raw_copper, and minecraft:raw_iron. I successfully traded for 2 raw iron last turn. I need two more iron ingots to craft the pickaxe.
- I have enough raw iron to smelt into two iron ingots. I'll use my cherry planks as fuel.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is minecraft:iron_pickaxe. I have minecraft:cherry_planks, minecraft:cobblestone, minecraft:iron_ingot, minecraft:raw_copper, and minecraft:raw_iron in hand. The opponent has minecraft:coal, minecraft:cobblestone, minecraft:oak_planks, minecraft:raw_copper, and minecraft:raw_iron. I successfully traded for 2 raw iron last turn. I need two more iron ingots to craft the pickaxe.
- I have enough raw iron to smelt into two iron ingots. I'll use my cherry planks as fuel.  I need to be precise with the fuel calculation to make sure the recipe is valid.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is `minecraft:iron_chestplate`. I currently have 3 `minecraft:raw_iron`, 1 `minecraft:coal`, 2 `minecraft:raw_copper`, 1 `minecraft:cobblestone`, and 1 `minecraft:oak_planks`.

I need to smelt my raw iron into ingots. I offered raw iron last turn, which might have been a mistake if the opponent's target also requires iron. I need to be more strategic about future trades.  I should avoid trading anything that could directly help the opponent.
- I need 8 iron ingots for the chestplate.
- Each iron ingot requires 1 raw iron and 1/8 of any fuel. I have enough raw iron, but limited fuel. I have 1 coal, enough to smelt 8 raw iron.  I will smelt all my raw iron this turn. I can consider trading for more fuel next turn if needed, but I'll try to avoid revealing my need for iron.  Since the opponent has coal and planks, they likely don't need fuel, so offering to trade for either might reveal my intentions.  Maybe I can offer oak planks for cherry planks, just to see what they do.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:

The opponent has minecraft:coal, minecraft:cobblestone, minecraft:oak_planks, minecraft:raw_copper, and minecraft:raw_iron. I successfully traded for 2 raw iron last turn. I need two more iron ingots to craft the pickaxe.
- I have enough raw iron to smelt into two iron ingots. I'll use my cherry planks as fuel.  I need to be precise with the fuel calculation to make sure the recipe is valid. Cherry planks provide 9/32 fuel each.  Smelting 1 raw iron requires 1/8 = 4/32 fuel. Smelting 2 raw iron requires 8/32 fuel.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:

Since the opponent has coal and planks, they likely don't need fuel, so offering to trade for either might reveal my intentions.  Maybe I can offer oak planks for cherry planks, just to see what they do.  Or perhaps offering cobblestone for their raw iron would be a good idea, as it would give me more iron to work with while potentially slowing them down if their target also needs iron.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I have enough raw iron to smelt into two iron ingots. I'll use my cherry planks as fuel.  I need to be precise with the fuel calculation to make sure the recipe is valid. Cherry planks provide 9/32 fuel each.  Smelting 1 raw iron requires 1/8 = 4/32 fuel. Smelting 2 raw iron requires 8/32 fuel. One cherry plank is enough.

### üñ• Server Event: `server__possible_recipes_from_hand`
Server shows the possible recipes of player 1 with his/her current hand crafts are: 
   - iron nugget
   - cobblestone slab from cobblestone stonecutting

   - cherry button
   - iron ingot from smelting raw iron

   - copper ingot from smelting raw copper
   - copper ingot from blasting raw copper
   - stone


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is `minecraft:iron_chestplate`. I currently have 3 `minecraft:raw_iron`, 1 `minecraft:coal`, 2 `minecraft:raw_copper`, 1 `minecraft:cobblestone`, and 1 `minecraft:oak_planks`. The opponent has 2 `minecraft:raw_iron`, 1 `minecraft:iron_ingot`, 1 `minecraft:coal`, 1 `minecraft:cobblestone`, 1 `minecraft:raw_copper`, and 1 `minecraft:cherry_planks`. I need to smelt my raw iron into ingots. I offered raw iron last turn, which might have been a mistake if the opponent's target also requires iron. I need to be more strategic about future trades.  I should avoid trading anything that could directly help the opponent.  I also need to consider that the opponent might be trying to deceive me with their trades.
- I need 8 iron ingots for the chestplate.
- Each iron ingot requires 1 raw iron and 1/8 of any fuel. I have enough raw iron and enough coal to smelt all of it.  I will smelt all my raw iron this turn. I can consider trading for more raw iron next turn.  Offering cobblestone for their raw iron might be a good strategy, as it gives me more iron while potentially slowing them down if their target also needs iron.  However, they might refuse if they suspect my intentions.  I could also try offering oak planks for their cherry planks, as a more neutral trade.  It won't directly help me, but it might give me some insight into their plans if they accept or refuse.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- player 1 says they need more iron ingots to craft a compass. A compass requires 4 iron ingots and 1 redstone dust.  They currently have 2 iron ingots. If I accept this trade, they will have enough iron ingots to craft a compass, assuming they can get redstone. I need to consider if giving them the ability to craft a compass is beneficial to me or not.  I also need to consider if getting another raw copper helps me get closer to my goal.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **compass**.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- player 1 says they need more iron ingots to craft a compass.  Even if they are being truthful, helping them get closer to a compass doesn't necessarily hurt me.  I have plenty of iron right now.  Getting another raw copper might be useful.  It's not a great trade, but it's not actively harmful.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Sure, I can trade you 2 iron ingots for 1 raw copper.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is `minecraft:iron_pickaxe`. I currently have 1 cobblestone and 4 iron ingots.  The opponent has 1 cobblestone, 1 iron ingot, 3 raw copper, and 1 oak planks. I need 2 sticks and 3 iron ingots to craft an iron pickaxe. I can craft sticks from planks, but I don't have any planks. My opponent has oak planks, so I could try to trade for them.
- Confirming the recipe for iron pickaxe and checking if there are other ways to get it.
- I need to get planks from the opponent. I can offer them some iron ingots since I have 4 and they only have 1.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is `minecraft:compass`.  The opponent just traded for more iron ingots, which strengthens my suspicion that their target also involves iron.  I have 3 raw copper, 1 iron ingot, 1 cobblestone, and 1 oak planks. I need more iron ingots to craft a compass.  I should try to trade for more iron.  <current status>
- I will check what I can craft with my current resources.
- I will also check the recipes for compass and iron ingot.
- Based on the possible recipes and the opponent's recent trade, I believe they are also aiming for something involving iron, possibly a compass or something else like shears or an iron pickaxe. I need to secure more iron ingots.  My opponent has 4 iron ingots and 1 raw iron.  I will offer them my 3 raw copper for 2 of their iron ingots. This would leave them with 2 iron ingots and 1 raw iron, not enough to craft a compass directly.
- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is `minecraft:iron_pickaxe`. I have 1 cobblestone and 4 iron ingots.  The opponent has 1 cobblestone, 1 iron ingot, 3 raw copper, and 1 oak planks. I need 2 sticks and 3 iron ingots to craft an iron pickaxe. I can craft sticks from planks. My opponent has oak planks, so I could try to trade for them. I have enough iron ingots to offer a fair trade.

- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is `minecraft:compass`. The opponent just traded for 2 of my iron ingots, giving them a total of 4 iron ingots and 1 raw iron.  They mentioned needing them for a compass, which is likely their target. I have 1 iron ingot, 3 raw copper, 1 cobblestone, and 1 oak planks. I need more iron ingots to craft a compass.  I should try to trade for more iron, but I need to be careful not to give them enough to complete their compass before me.  <current status>
- I will check what I can craft with my current resources.
- I will also check the recipes for compass and iron ingot.
- I need 4 iron ingots and 1 redstone to craft a compass. My opponent has enough iron to craft a compass if they have redstone. I need to prevent them from getting redstone if possible.  I don't have much to offer them in trade, and giving them more raw copper might help them craft something else. I'll offer a trade for their raw iron, hoping they might accept it for something seemingly useless to me like cobblestone. This would leave them with only 4 iron ingots, preventing them from crafting shears.
- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:

They explicitly stated their need for iron ingots to craft a compass.  I have 1 iron ingot, 3 raw copper, 1 cobblestone, and 1 oak planks. I need more iron ingots and redstone to craft a compass. My priority is to acquire more iron ingots, but I also need to be mindful of the opponent's progress and prevent them from getting redstone.  <current status>
- I will check what I can craft with my current resources.
- I will also check the recipes for compass, iron ingot, and shears.
- I need to acquire more iron ingots.  My opponent has 4 iron ingots, enough to craft a compass if they have redstone.  Trading for their raw iron might be beneficial, but I don't have much to offer that they would likely accept.  I could offer them my oak planks, which are of no use to me currently, in exchange for their raw iron. This might disrupt their plans if they are aiming for something involving wood, and it gives me a chance to smelt the raw iron into an iron ingot.
- I think I have a good plan.

I need 2 sticks and 3 iron ingots to craft an iron pickaxe. I can craft sticks from planks. My opponent has 1 oak planks, which is not enough to make the 2 sticks I need (2 planks are needed for 4 sticks). I could try to trade for their planks and then consider alternative strategies if that fails.

- I will check what I can craft with my current resources.
- I will also check the recipes for compass, iron ingot, and shears.
- I need to acquire more iron ingots and redstone. My opponent having 4 iron ingots makes me concerned they might have a source of redstone or are close to acquiring it.  I need to consider what I can offer them that won't help them and might even hinder their progress.  Oak planks are of no use to me, and cobblestone is only useful for basic tools. Offering both for their raw iron might be a good strategy. It gives me a small chance of getting the raw iron, and even if they refuse, it doesn't cost me anything valuable.

- I need 3 more iron ingots and redstone to craft a compass. My opponent having 4 iron ingots is a threat. They could be crafting shears or waiting for redstone for a compass.  I need to be proactive in acquiring more iron. Since I don't have much to offer, I'll try a desperate trade for 2 of their iron ingots, offering all 3 of my raw copper. This is a gamble, but it's a calculated risk. If it works, I'll be much closer to my goal. If it doesn't, I'll need to re-evaluate.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`

player 1 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Thanks for the offer!


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is `minecraft:compass`.  The opponent, player 1, seems to be trying to craft a compass as well, as they traded for iron ingots and mentioned it in their message. I need to acquire a redstone and more iron ingots to craft a compass. I currently have 1 iron ingot, 1 copper ingot, 1 raw copper, 1 raw iron, and 1 cobblestone.  I should try to trade for more iron ingots and redstone if possible.
- Let's see what I can craft with my current resources.  It's unlikely I can craft anything useful towards my goal right now. I need to focus on trading.  <current status>
- I will propose a trade to player 1. I'll offer my raw iron and copper ingot for their raw iron and hopefully an iron ingot. If they refuse, I'll try offering more raw copper next turn.  I'll also ask if they have any redstone to trade.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is minecraft:iron_pickaxe. I currently have 1 cobblestone and 4 iron ingots.  The opponent has 1 cobblestone, 1 copper ingot, 1 iron ingot, 1 raw copper, and 1 raw iron. I need 3 iron ingots and 2 sticks to craft an iron pickaxe. I can craft sticks from planks, which I don't have. My opponent has oak planks, which could be traded for.
- Confirming the recipe for iron pickaxe and checking how to make sticks.
- I need planks to make sticks.  I'll try to trade for oak planks from the opponent.  <current status>
- I will propose a trade of 1 iron ingot for 1 oak plank. This seems like a fair trade, as they can use the iron ingot and I can use the oak plank.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is `minecraft:compass`.  Player 1 likely also wants a compass, given their trades and message. I need redstone and more iron ingots. I have 1 iron ingot, 1 copper ingot, 1 raw copper, 1 raw iron, and 1 cobblestone.  I need to trade strategically.
- Checking craftable recipes is a good first step, but I doubt I can craft anything directly contributing to the compass yet.  Trading is key.  <current status>
- I'll offer my raw iron and copper ingot for their raw iron and an iron ingot. This gives them copper which they might want, but doesn't significantly advance them towards a compass.  Asking about redstone is crucial. If they refuse, I'll adjust my offer next turn, perhaps offering more raw copper or the cobblestone.

- My target is `minecraft:compass`. Player 1 likely also wants a compass, judging by their trades and message. I need redstone and more iron ingots. I have 1 iron ingot, 1 copper ingot, 1 raw copper, 1 raw iron, and 1 cobblestone.  Trading is crucial.
- Checking craftable recipes is a good first step, but I doubt I can craft anything directly contributing to the compass yet.  Trading is the priority.  <current status>
- I'll offer my raw iron and copper ingot for their raw iron and an iron ingot. This gives them copper, but doesn't significantly help them with a compass.  Asking about redstone is key. If they refuse, I'll adjust next turn, perhaps offering more raw copper or the cobblestone.  I need to be mindful of not giving them too much iron.  Since they have 4 iron ingots, I want to avoid them getting to 4 iron_ingots.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is minecraft:iron_pickaxe. I have 1 cobblestone and 4 iron ingots. The opponent has 1 cobblestone, 1 copper ingot, 1 iron ingot, 1 raw copper, and 1 raw iron. I need 2 sticks and 3 iron ingots to craft an iron pickaxe.  Sticks are crafted from planks. My opponent has no planks. I need to find another way to get planks.  I could try trading for logs again, or consider alternative tools.
- Confirming the recipe for iron pickaxe and checking how to make sticks.
- I need planks to make sticks. I don't have any, and neither does my opponent.  Trading for logs is the most direct path.  <current status>
- I'll propose a trade of 1 more iron ingot for any type of log. This is a significant offer, so hopefully they'll accept. If not, I'll have to seriously consider alternative tools.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is minecraft:iron_pickaxe. I have 1 cobblestone and 4 iron ingots. The opponent has 1 cobblestone, 1 copper ingot, 1 iron ingot, 1 raw copper, and 1 raw iron. I need 2 sticks and 3 iron ingots to craft an iron pickaxe.  Sticks are crafted from planks, which are crafted from logs. My opponent has no planks or logs. I've tried trading for logs multiple times without success. I need to consider alternative tools.  A wooden pickaxe is an option, but less efficient.  A stone pickaxe is also possible if I can get more cobblestone.
- Checking the recipe for a wooden pickaxe.
- Checking the recipe for a stone pickaxe.  <current status>
- I'll propose a trade of 2 iron ingots for 2 cobblestone. This would allow me to craft a stone pickaxe. If that fails, I'll focus on getting the materials for a wooden pickaxe, which will require trading for logs again.
