### üñ• Server Event: `server__private_start_info`
player 1 enters the game with a private target: [minecraft:stone_shovel * 1, ]



## üåÄ Turn 1 start!
----------------------------------------

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a bucket.  Buckets require iron ingots. I already have one iron ingot.  I need two more. My opponent has a lot of raw iron. I should try to trade for some.  I'll offer them my coal, as it's less useful to me right now, and request some raw iron. I'll also ask for their cobblestone, as it could be useful for various crafting recipes.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **bucket**.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- The item info confirms that I need 3 iron ingots for a bucket.  My plan to trade for raw iron makes sense.  Since they have 5 raw iron, I'll request 2.  I'll offer my coal and cobblestone, as I don't need them immediately for my goal.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:coal * 1, minecraft:cobblestone * 1, ] together with a text message: I'm looking to craft some tools.  Would you be willing to trade 2 raw iron for some coal and cobblestone?


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I need cobblestone to craft a stone shovel. I have raw iron, but I don't need coal right now.  This trade gives me an extra cobblestone, which is good. I'll accept.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Sounds good.


### üñ• Server Event: `server__update_all_hands`
Server updated all hands:
player 2 hand: [minecraft:cherry_planks * 1, minecraft:iron_ingot * 1, minecraft:raw_copper * 1, minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ]
player 1 hand: [minecraft:coal * 1, minecraft:cobblestone * 2, minecraft:oak_planks * 1, minecraft:raw_copper * 2, minecraft:raw_iron * 3, ]


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I have 2 cobblestone, 1 coal, 1 oak_planks, 2 raw_copper, and 3 raw_iron.  Player 2 has 1 cherry_planks, 1 iron_ingot, 1 raw_copper, and 2 raw_iron. A stone shovel requires cobblestone and sticks. Sticks require planks. I have oak_planks.
- I need to confirm the recipes for stone_shovel and sticks.  <current status>
- I predict the item_info output for "stone_shovel" will show that it needs cobblestone and a stick.  I also predict that the item_info output for "stick" will show that it needs 2 planks to make 4 sticks. I have enough cobblestone and oak_planks to make a stone_shovel.
- This will show me all the possible recipes I can craft with my current hand. I expect to see the recipes for sticks and a stone_shovel.
- I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket.  I need 3 iron ingots to craft it. I currently have 1 iron ingot.  Player 1 has 3 raw iron, which can be smelted into 3 iron ingots. I traded for 2 raw iron last turn, which I can smelt into 2 iron ingots.  With my existing iron ingot, that's enough for a bucket. My priority is to smelt the raw iron. I need fuel for the furnace. I traded away my coal last turn. I have cherry planks, which can be used as fuel.
- Confirming the recipe for iron ingots and bucket.
- I need to figure out the correct ratio of planks to fuel the furnace to smelt the raw iron.
- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I have 2 cobblestone, 1 coal, 1 oak_planks, 2 raw_copper, and 3 raw_iron.  Player 2 has 1 cherry_planks, 1 iron_ingot, 1 raw_copper, and 2 raw_iron. A stone shovel requires cobblestone and sticks. Sticks require planks. I have oak_planks.
- I need to confirm the recipes for stone_shovel and sticks.  <current status>
- I predict the item_info output for "stone_shovel" will show that it needs cobblestone and a stick.  I also predict that the item_info output for "stick" will show that it needs 2 planks to make 4 sticks. I have enough cobblestone and oak_planks to make a stone_shovel.  I will need to use only half the sticks created (1 stick) for the shovel, leaving me with 3 sticks remaining.
- This will show me all the possible recipes I can craft with my current hand. I expect to see the recipes for sticks and a stone_shovel.
- I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket. I need 3 iron ingots to craft it. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron.  I will smelt the 2 raw iron into iron ingots. This will give me the 3 iron ingots I need. I have cherry planks for fuel.
- Checking the exact fuel requirements for smelting raw iron.
- Double checking the bucket recipe.
- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I have 2 cobblestone, 1 coal, 1 oak_planks, 2 raw_copper, and 3 raw_iron.  Player 2 has 1 cherry_planks, 1 iron_ingot, 1 raw_copper, and 2 raw_iron. A stone shovel requires cobblestone and sticks. Sticks require planks. I have enough oak_planks to make the sticks.
- I predict the item_info output for "stone_shovel" will show that it needs cobblestone and a stick.  I also predict that the item_info output for "stick" will show that it needs 2 planks to make 4 sticks. I have enough cobblestone and oak_planks to make a stone_shovel. I will need to use only half the planks to create enough sticks (2) for the shovel, leaving me with 2 sticks remaining.
- This will show me all the possible recipes I can craft with my current hand. I expect to see the recipes for sticks and a stone_shovel.
- I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket. I need 3 iron ingots to craft it. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron.  I will smelt the 2 raw iron into iron ingots. This will give me the 3 iron ingots I need. I have cherry planks for fuel.
- Checking the exact fuel requirements for smelting raw iron and confirming the fuel value of cherry planks.
- Double checking the bucket recipe.
- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I predict the item_info output for "stone_shovel" will show that it needs cobblestone and a stick.  Then, I'll check the recipe for sticks.
- I predict the item_info output for "stick" will show that it needs 2 planks to make 4 sticks. I have enough cobblestone and oak_planks to make a stone_shovel. I will need to use only half the planks to create enough sticks (2) for the shovel, leaving me with 2 sticks remaining.

I have cherry planks for fuel. I'll confirm the fuel value of cherry planks and check available recipes.
- Double checking the bucket recipe and available recipes from my hand.
- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I predict the item_info output for "stone_shovel" will show that it needs cobblestone and a stick.  Then, I'll check the recipe for sticks.
- I predict the item_info output for "stick" will show that it needs 2 planks to make 4 sticks.  Since I only need 1 stick, I'll use half the ingredients (1 plank) to make 2 sticks. I have enough cobblestone and oak_planks to make a stone_shovel.
- This will show me all the possible recipes I can craft with my current hand. I expect to see the recipes for sticks and possibly a stone_shovel (if the tool recognizes partial recipes).
- I have a good plan.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **stick**.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket. I need 3 iron ingots to craft it. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron.  I will smelt the 2 raw iron into iron ingots. This will give me the 3 iron ingots I need. I have cherry planks for fuel. I'll use possible_recipes_from_hand to determine the correct smelting recipe.
- I'll review the output of possible_recipes_from_hand to find the correct recipe for smelting raw iron using cherry planks. Then, I'll plan to craft the bucket.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__craft_recipe_check`

## üåÄ Turn 2 start!
----------------------------------------

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I need a stone shovel.  A stone shovel requires cobblestone and sticks. I have cobblestone, but I need sticks. Sticks are crafted from planks. I have oak planks, so I can make sticks and then a shovel. I don't need to trade.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [], offer [] together with a text message: I don't need anything right now.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- They are offering nothing and requesting nothing. This is unusual.  It could be a genuine offer of goodwill, or a deceptive tactic to appear non-threatening.  I need to consider my goal, which is to acquire a bucket.  Buckets are made of iron ingots. I already have one iron ingot.  I need two more.  I have two raw iron.  I could smelt them into iron ingots if I had fuel.  Player 1 has coal, which is a fuel source.  Perhaps their next move will be to request my raw iron in exchange for coal.  Rejecting this null trade might make them suspicious.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **bucket**.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- Confirming that a bucket requires 3 iron ingots. I have one, and two raw iron.  I need coal to smelt the raw iron.  Accepting this trade doesn't hurt me, and might encourage them to offer coal later.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Thanks!


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- It's my turn to craft. I need to figure out what my target is and what I can craft with the items in my hand.  I have cherry planks, an iron ingot, raw copper, and raw iron.  I should check what recipes are available to me.
- Let's see what recipes I can make with my current items.  I'll analyze the output and decide on the best crafting path based on my target item (which I still need to determine).  <current status>
- Assuming my target is something involving iron, I should smelt the raw iron.  I need fuel for that.  I have cherry planks which can be used as fuel.
- I'll plan to smelt the raw iron into iron ingots.  I'll need to calculate the amount of planks needed for fuel.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is `minecraft:iron_pickaxe`. Currently, I have `minecraft:coal: 1`, `minecraft:cobblestone: 2`, `minecraft:oak_planks: 1`, `minecraft:raw_copper: 2`, and `minecraft:raw_iron: 3`.  The other player, player 2, has `minecraft:cherry_planks: 1`, `minecraft:iron_ingot: 1`, `minecraft:raw_copper: 1`, and `minecraft:raw_iron: 2`.
- To craft an iron pickaxe, I need 3 iron ingots and 2 sticks. I can craft sticks from planks, and iron ingots from raw iron. I have enough raw iron, but I need more planks. I could trade some raw copper for player 2's cherry planks.
- Confirming the recipe for iron_pickaxe and its components.
- Confirming the recipe for sticks.
- Checking what I can craft with my current resources.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is `minecraft:iron_pickaxe`. I have `minecraft:coal: 1`, `minecraft:cobblestone: 2`, `minecraft:oak_planks: 1`, `minecraft:raw_copper: 2`, and `minecraft:raw_iron: 3`. Player 2 has `minecraft:cherry_planks: 1`, `minecraft:iron_ingot: 1`, `minecraft:raw_copper: 1`, and `minecraft:raw_iron: 2`.
- I need 3 iron ingots and 2 sticks for the iron pickaxe. I have enough raw iron for the ingots.  I have 1 oak plank, and I can trade for player 2's cherry plank to get 2 planks total, enough for 4 sticks. I need coal for smelting the raw iron.
- Confirming the iron_pickaxe recipe.
- Confirming the iron ingot recipe and fuel requirements.
- Confirming the stick recipe.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- It's my turn to craft. My hand contains: cherry planks (1), iron ingot (1), raw copper (1), and raw iron (2). I need to determine my target item and the most efficient crafting path.  I'll start by checking available recipes.
- I'll analyze the output of `possible_recipes_from_hand` to see what I can craft.  I'll prioritize recipes that move me closer to my target item (which I still need to figure out).  If I can't deduce my target yet, I'll focus on smelting the raw iron, as iron ingots are generally useful.  I'll need to use my cherry planks as fuel.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is `minecraft:iron_pickaxe`. I have `minecraft:coal: 1`, `minecraft:cobblestone: 2`, `minecraft:oak_planks: 1`, `minecraft:raw_copper: 2`, and `minecraft:raw_iron: 3`.

If I can't deduce my target yet, I'll focus on smelting the raw iron, as iron ingots are generally useful.  I'll need to use my cherry planks as fuel.  I'll also consider that I might need to keep some planks for crafting later, so I won't use all of it as fuel at once.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is `minecraft:iron_pickaxe`. I have `minecraft:coal: 1`, `minecraft:cobblestone: 2`, `minecraft:oak_planks: 1`, `minecraft:raw_copper: 2`, and `minecraft:raw_iron: 3`.

## üåÄ Turn 3 start!
----------------------------------------

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- I have copper ingot, iron ingot, and raw iron.  They have coal, cobblestone, oak planks, raw copper, and raw iron. I crafted a copper ingot last turn, so I'm probably working towards something that uses copper.  They haven't crafted anything obvious yet.  I could try to trade for more raw iron to make more iron ingots, or maybe try to get some coal to smelt my raw iron myself.  I'll check the recipes for copper ingots and iron ingots to see what I might need.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **copper_ingot**.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- I could use coal to smelt my raw iron.  They have coal, so I could offer them something in exchange.  They have a lot of raw materials, but not much in the way of crafted items.  Maybe they're aiming for something simple.  I'll offer them my copper ingot for their coal, since I can always make more copper ingots if I need to.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:coal * 1, ], offer [minecraft:copper_ingot * 1, ] together with a text message: I'll trade you this copper ingot for some coal.  I need to power my furnace.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I have coal and two raw copper.  If I trade for this copper ingot, I can smelt my raw copper into copper ingots.  This could be useful for crafting later.  I'll check the recipes for copper ingots.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **copper_ingot**.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- This trade seems beneficial. I'll accept the trade.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Thanks for the trade!


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is `minecraft:iron_pickaxe`. I have 2 `minecraft:cobblestone`, 1 `minecraft:copper_ingot`, 1 `minecraft:oak_planks`, 2 `minecraft:raw_copper`, and 3 `minecraft:raw_iron`.  The opponent has 1 `minecraft:coal`, 1 `minecraft:iron_ingot`, and 2 `minecraft:raw_iron`. I need more iron ingots to craft an iron pickaxe. I can smelt my raw iron, but I need coal for fuel. I just traded my coal away.
- I need to get coal back or find another fuel source.  My opponent has coal and might be willing to trade.  I could offer them raw copper since they have none and might want to make more copper ingots.  Alternatively, I could try to smelt my raw copper into copper ingots and use planks as fuel, but that's less efficient.  <current status>
- I think the best plan is to try and trade for coal again. I'll offer 1 raw copper for 1 coal.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is `minecraft:blast_furnace`.  I currently have `minecraft:coal: 1`, `minecraft:iron_ingot: 1`, and `minecraft:raw_iron: 2`. Player 1 has `minecraft:cobblestone: 2`, `minecraft:copper_ingot: 1`, `minecraft:oak_planks: 1`, `minecraft:raw_copper: 2`, and `minecraft:raw_iron: 3`. I need five iron ingots and a furnace to craft a blast furnace. I have one iron ingot, so I need four more. I can smelt my two raw iron into two iron ingots.  I can also try to trade for more raw iron from player 1.  They seem willing to trade, so that's a good option.  I also need a furnace.
- I need to figure out how to make a furnace.  Let's see what the recipe is.  <current status>
- Assuming the furnace recipe requires cobblestone, I should try to trade for some from player 1.  I can offer them my coal since I only need one to smelt my raw iron.
- I need to plan my crafting steps carefully. First, I'll smelt the raw iron. Then, if I get enough cobblestone, I'll craft the furnace. Finally, with enough iron, I'll craft the blast furnace.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is `minecraft:iron_pickaxe`. I have 2 `minecraft:cobblestone`, 1 `minecraft:copper_ingot`, 1 `minecraft:oak_planks`, 2 `minecraft:raw_copper`, and 3 `minecraft:raw_iron`.  The opponent has 1 `minecraft:coal`, 1 `minecraft:iron_ingot`, and 2 `minecraft:raw_iron`. I need more iron ingots to craft an iron pickaxe. I can smelt my raw iron, but I need coal for fuel. I just traded my coal away.  I need to get it back or find another fuel source.
- Confirmed - need 3 iron ingots and 2 sticks for the pickaxe.  Sticks are easy enough to make from planks.  Iron ingots require smelting raw iron with fuel.  I could use planks as fuel in a pinch, but coal is much more efficient.  The opponent has coal.  <current status>
- Trading for coal is the priority.  Offering raw copper seems like the best bet, as the opponent doesn't have any and might want to make more copper ingots.  I'll offer 1 raw copper for 1 coal.  If that fails, I'll have to resort to using planks as fuel, which will delay my pickaxe crafting.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is `minecraft:blast_furnace`. I have `minecraft:coal: 1`, `minecraft:iron_ingot: 1`, and `minecraft:raw_iron: 2`. Player 1 has `minecraft:cobblestone: 2`, `minecraft:copper_ingot: 1`, `minecraft:oak_planks: 1`, `minecraft:raw_copper: 2`, and `minecraft:raw_iron: 3`.  I need five iron ingots and a furnace to craft a blast furnace. I can smelt my two raw iron into two iron ingots, bringing my total to three.  I need two more.  Player 1 has three raw iron, so trading for some is crucial.  I also need to know the furnace recipe.
- Now I know the furnace recipe.  Let's assume it's the standard 8 cobblestone. I need to trade for enough cobblestone and raw iron from player 1. I can offer them my coal since I only need a portion to smelt my raw iron.  I should be careful not to give away too much, as they might need it too.
- I need to plan my crafting steps carefully. First, I'll smelt my raw iron. Then, if the trade is successful and I have enough cobblestone, I'll craft the furnace.  Then, I'll smelt any additional raw iron I received in the trade. Finally, if I have enough iron ingots, I'll craft the blast furnace.

The opponent has 1 `minecraft:coal`, 1 `minecraft:iron_ingot`, and 2 `minecraft:raw_iron`. I need more iron ingots to craft an iron pickaxe. I can smelt my raw iron, but I need coal for fuel. I just traded my coal away.  I need to get it back or find another fuel source.  Planks can be used as fuel, but it's less efficient.
- Confirmed - need 3 iron ingots and 2 sticks for the pickaxe.  Sticks are easy enough to make from planks.  Iron ingots require smelting raw iron with fuel.  Trading for coal is the priority.  Offering raw copper seems like the best bet, as the opponent doesn't have any and might want to make more copper ingots.  I'll offer 1 raw copper for 1 coal.  If that fails, I'll have to resort to using planks as fuel, which will delay my pickaxe crafting.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I can't seem to get information on the comparator or nether quartz.  I'll focus on getting more iron ingots from my opponent.  I'll offer them my extra raw copper and copper ingot for one of their iron ingots.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:iron_ingot * 1, ], offer [minecraft:copper_ingot * 1, minecraft:raw_copper * 2, ] together with a text message: I have some extra copper. Would you trade one iron ingot for it?


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- They are offering 1 copper ingot and 2 raw copper for 1 iron ingot.  I have plenty of iron right now, and could turn that raw copper into another ingot. This trade seems beneficial to me.  It also gives me insight into what they might be crafting.  Let's see what recipes use copper.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **copper_ingot**.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Thanks for the copper!


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:

The opponent has 1 `minecraft:copper_ingot`, 2 `minecraft:iron_ingot`, and 2 `minecraft:raw_copper`. I need sticks to craft the iron pickaxe.  I can craft sticks from planks, but I traded away my oak planks last turn.  I could ask the opponent for their cherry planks.
- I need to confirm the recipe for iron_pickaxe and sticks.  <current status>
- I can smelt my raw iron into iron ingots, then craft the pickaxe if I can get sticks.  I'll propose a trade for the opponent's cherry planks. If they accept, I can craft sticks and then the pickaxe. If not, I'll smelt the raw iron anyway and try to get planks next turn.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is `minecraft:blast_furnace`.  I currently have 2 iron ingots, 1 copper ingot, and 2 raw copper. The opponent has 2 iron ingots, 2 raw iron, 2 cobblestone, and 1 oak planks. I just traded 1 iron ingot for 1 copper ingot and 2 raw copper.  I need to figure out how to get more iron ingots.  I need a total of 5 iron ingots and 3 smooth stone for the blast furnace.
- I need to smelt my raw copper into copper ingots, and then trade for more iron.  I need to find a way to get coal or some other fuel source.  I could also try to get cobblestone from the opponent and make smooth stone myself.  <current status>
- I will smelt the raw copper into copper ingots. Then, I will propose a trade of 1 copper ingot for 1 iron ingot. If the opponent accepts, I will be closer to my goal. If not, I will try to get cobblestone to make smooth stone.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:

I need to figure out how many sticks I can make from different types of planks.
- I now know how many sticks I can craft from planks. I'll propose a trade to the opponent for planks. If they accept, I can craft sticks and then the pickaxe. If not, I'll smelt the raw iron and try to get planks next turn.  I also need fuel to smelt the raw iron. I traded away my coal earlier. I'll see if I can get some fuel in the trade as well.

I need more iron and a way to get smooth stone (either by trading for cobblestone or finding a way to make it). I also need fuel.
- I have confirmed the recipe for the blast furnace. Now I need to focus on acquiring the necessary materials.  My priority is getting more iron ingots.  Trading for them is the fastest way.  If that fails, I need to consider how to get the opponent's raw iron.  I also need to smelt my raw copper into copper ingots to use for trading.  I need fuel for that.  I'll try trading for coal first.

- I've confirmed the blast furnace recipe.  I need to prioritize getting more iron and coal.  If I can get coal, I can smelt my raw copper into more copper ingots for trading.  If I can't trade for iron, I need to consider how to get the opponent's raw iron, which might involve trading for it or disrupting their plans.  Getting cobblestone for smooth stone is also important, but secondary to getting iron and fuel.

- My opponent just crafted shears, which requires two iron ingots. They traded for iron last turn, and now they have none left. This suggests they might need more iron for something else. I have two iron ingots, and I could trade one for something useful to me, while also potentially slowing down my opponent by reducing their access to iron.  I also have some copper, which they might want. I'll offer one raw copper for one cobblestone.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:

player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:cobblestone * 1, ], offer [minecraft:raw_copper * 1, ] together with a text message: I have some extra copper. Would you trade it for a cobblestone?


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I have 2 cobblestone and 2 raw iron. My target is shears, which I already have.  I don't need cobblestone for anything, and raw copper could be useful for crafting other things. Trading cobblestone for raw copper seems beneficial.

I have cobblestone, raw_copper, raw_iron, and shears. I should avoid trading away anything that could help the opponent craft shears.  I should also consider what the opponent's target might be and try to prevent them from getting it.

I need a total of 9 iron ingots to make an iron block. I have 2, so I need 7 more.  My opponent likely needs more iron as well, judging by their previous trades. I should try to acquire as much raw iron as possible.
- Let's see what I can craft with what I have.  Probably not much, but it's worth checking.  <current status>
- Based on the possible recipes, I can't craft anything useful towards my goal right now.  My best bet is to trade for more raw iron. My opponent has 2 raw iron. I can offer them my raw copper and cobblestone, which they might need for other crafting recipes.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- They are offering me 1 copper ingot and 1 raw copper for 1 raw iron.  I need iron ingots to craft shears, and I can smelt raw iron into iron ingots if I have fuel. Copper is not directly useful for my target. However, getting more raw copper might be useful for future trades. Let's check what I can craft with copper.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`

Since I don't have fuel, getting the copper ingot now saves me a step.  Accepting the trade seems beneficial.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- I have cobblestone, raw iron, and shears. The opponent has cobblestone, copper ingot, raw copper, raw iron, and shears. I traded away my copper for their raw iron last turn. My target is shears, which I already have. The opponent likely needs more iron to make shears or something else iron-related.  <current status>
- Since I've already achieved my target, my goal now is to prevent the opponent from getting theirs.  I should analyze their actions to guess their target and then try to prevent them from acquiring the necessary components. They seem to be accumulating copper and iron.
- I should check what I can craft with my current items and what the opponent can craft with theirs.
- I'll also check the recipes involving iron and copper, since the opponent seems interested in those.
- Based on the possible recipes and the opponent's actions, I'll formulate a plan to hinder their progress.  If they try to trade for my raw iron, I'll refuse. I'll also consider offering trades that might distract them or deplete their resources of other useful items.

- I have cobblestone, raw iron, and shears. My opponent has cobblestone, copper ingot, raw copper, raw iron, and shears. I already have my target (shears).  My primary goal now is to prevent my opponent from winning.  <current status>
- The opponent might be trying to craft something requiring iron or copper, given their previous trades.  They traded for my copper earlier and tried to trade for my raw iron last turn.  Denying them these resources is key.
- I should see what they could potentially craft with their resources.  Knowing their possible crafting paths will help me predict their goal and block them effectively.
- I also want to see all the recipes involving iron and copper to understand what the opponent might be aiming for.
- Based on their hand and potential recipes, I'll devise a plan to obstruct their progress.  Refusing trades for raw iron is crucial.  I can also offer misleading trades to waste their resources or lead them down the wrong crafting path.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I need to consider if this trade benefits my crafting goals. My target is shears, which I already have.  Having more cobblestone might be useful for some recipes, but raw iron is also important.  Since I already have one cobblestone, getting another one isn't a high priority.  Keeping the raw iron might be more beneficial in the long run.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My current hand consists of cobblestone, raw iron, and shears.  Player 1 has cobblestone, copper ingot, raw copper, raw iron, and shears.  Trading raw iron for raw copper doesn't seem immediately beneficial to me. I need to consider my target item and how this trade might affect my ability to craft it.  I also need to consider if this trade would help my opponent.  I've traded copper for iron with them before, so they might be trying to get iron for something specific.  Denying them the iron might slow them down.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **iron_ingot**.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- Since I can smelt raw iron into iron ingots, trading my raw iron for raw copper is not a good idea.  It's more beneficial for me to keep the raw iron and potentially craft it into something useful, especially since I know how to make iron ingots.  Rejecting the trade also denies my opponent the raw iron, which could be beneficial to me.

I could offer them my raw iron, but I'm not sure what to ask for in return. Maybe something that would be useful for crafting tools or armor, but not helpful for them.  I'll check the recipes for shears since they already have a pair.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **shears**.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- Okay, shears require iron ingots.  They have raw iron, which they could smelt into iron ingots.  Since they seem interested in acquiring more iron, maybe they are trying to make more shears or something else requiring iron. I'll offer them my raw iron, and request their raw copper in return. This gives them more iron towards their potential goal, while I gather copper which they seem less interested in.  This could be a win-win, or at least a win for me if it throws them off.
