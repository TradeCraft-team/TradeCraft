## 🌀 Turn 1 start!
----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a bucket.  Buckets require iron ingots. I already have one iron ingot.  I need two more. My opponent has a lot of raw iron. I should try to trade for some. I also need fuel for the furnace. I have coal, which is a good fuel source.  I'll offer some of my less useful items like cherry planks and cobblestone in exchange for the raw iron.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **bucket**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I need 2 more iron ingots.  My opponent has 5 raw iron.  It takes one raw iron to make one iron ingot. I'll ask for 2 raw iron. I'll offer my cherry planks and cobblestone since I don't need them for my goal.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:cherry_planks * 1, minecraft:cobblestone * 1, ] together with a text message: I'd like to trade my cherry planks and cobblestone for some of your raw iron.  I'm trying to build some storage.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a lever.  A lever requires a stick and cobblestone. I already have cobblestone.  Sticks are crafted from planks.  This trade offers cherry planks, which I can use to make sticks.  I have plenty of raw iron.  This trade seems beneficial.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Sounds good.  I need the planks.

- My target is a lever.  I need a stick and a cobblestone. I have 2 cobblestone and I traded for a cherry plank which can be used to make sticks.  The other player traded for some raw iron, they might be trying to make an iron ingot, or perhaps shears or a bucket.  <current status>
