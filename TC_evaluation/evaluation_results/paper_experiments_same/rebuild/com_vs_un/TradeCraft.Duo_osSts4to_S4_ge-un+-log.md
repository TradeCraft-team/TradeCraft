## üåÄ Turn 1 start!
----------------------------------------

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I need to acquire more iron to craft chain. My opponent has a lot of raw iron, which I can smelt into iron ingots. I can offer them coal to smelt their raw iron, and request some of the resulting iron ingots in return, or request some raw iron directly.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **chain**.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I need 2 iron ingots or 1 iron ingot and 2 iron nuggets to craft a chain.  I have 1 iron ingot, so I need at least 1 more.  My opponent has 5 raw iron. I can offer them coal to smelt it, and request some of the raw iron or iron ingots in return.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:coal * 1, ] together with a text message: I have coal, you have raw iron. I can give you coal to smelt your iron, and you can give me some of the raw iron in return.  This will benefit both of us.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a stone_shovel.  A stone_shovel requires cobblestone and sticks. I already have cobblestone. Sticks are crafted from planks, and I have oak planks.  Therefore, I don't need anything from the opponent right now. Trading raw iron for coal would help me smelt the iron, but it's not essential for my immediate goal.  Giving away raw iron could potentially help the opponent, and I don't know their goal. It's better to be cautious and conserve resources.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2 decided to reject the proposal with a text message: I don't need coal right now.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I need cobblestone and sticks. I have cobblestone, but I need sticks.  Sticks are crafted from planks. I have oak_planks, so I can craft sticks. My opponent has coal and iron_ingot, which I don't need right now.  They rejected my trade for coal, likely because they want to smelt their raw_copper or craft torches.
- Let's see what I can craft with what I have.  I should prioritize crafting sticks, then the shovel.  <current status>
- I have enough oak_planks to make sticks, and I have the cobblestone for the shovel.  I should craft the sticks first, then the shovel.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is 1 chain. I have cherry planks, coal, cobblestone, iron ingot, and raw copper. My opponent has cobblestone, oak planks, raw copper, and raw iron.  I need 2 iron ingots and 1 chain to craft a chain. I only have 1 iron ingot. My opponent has 5 raw iron which can be smelted into 5 iron ingots. I need to trade for at least 1 iron ingot or 2 raw iron.
- I need to confirm the recipe for chain.  Also, I should check if there are any intermediate crafts I can do with my current resources.
- I'll analyze the possible recipes and see if any are beneficial for my goal.  I'll also consider what my opponent might be trying to craft and how I can prevent them from getting the necessary resources.  My opponent rejected my coal offer, perhaps they have enough fuel or are not smelting anything.  They have a lot of raw iron, so maybe their target requires iron ingots.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I need cobblestone and sticks. I have 1 cobblestone and 1 oak_planks.  I need 2 oak_planks to make 4 sticks, and then 2 sticks and 1 cobblestone to make the shovel. I'm short one oak_plank. My opponent has items I don't currently need. They rejected my trade for coal, probably because they want to use it themselves.  I need to try to get another oak_plank from them.
- Let's confirm what I can craft with my current resources.  <current status>
- I can't craft the shovel yet because I'm missing one oak_plank.  I need to focus on acquiring that plank.  I can offer some raw_iron for it, since I have a surplus.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is 1 chain. I have cherry planks, coal, cobblestone, iron ingot, and raw copper. My opponent has cobblestone, oak planks, raw copper, and raw iron. I need 2 iron ingots to craft a chain. I only have 1 iron ingot. My opponent has 5 raw iron which can be smelted into 5 iron ingots. I need to trade for at least 1 iron ingot or 2 raw iron.  Since they rejected coal last time, I'll try offering something else.
- Confirming the chain recipe.  I also need to check what I can craft with raw copper since I have some and so does my opponent.
- Analyzing possible uses for raw copper.  I'll also check what I can make from my current hand.
- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I need cobblestone and sticks. I have 1 cobblestone and 1 oak_planks.  I need 2 planks to make sticks. I'm short one plank. My opponent has cherry_planks, which I can use. They rejected my trade for coal, probably because they want to use it themselves.  I need to try to get a plank from them.  Since they rejected 2 raw_iron for coal, I'll offer more this time.
- Let's confirm what I can craft with my current resources.  I'll also check what recipes use planks, to see if there are other options besides cherry_planks.
- I still need another plank.  I'll offer more raw_iron for a cherry_plank.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is 1 chain. I have cherry planks, coal, cobblestone, iron ingot, and raw copper. My opponent has cobblestone, oak planks, raw copper, and raw iron. I need 2 iron ingots to craft a chain. I only have 1 iron ingot. My opponent has 5 raw iron which can be smelted into 5 iron ingots. I need to trade for at least 1 iron ingot or 2 raw iron.  Since they rejected coal last time, I'll try offering something else.  I should also check if I can craft anything useful from my current resources.
- Confirming the chain recipe.  I also need to check what I can craft with raw copper since I have some and so does my opponent.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I need cobblestone and sticks. I have 1 cobblestone and 1 oak_planks.  I need 2 planks to make sticks. I'm short one plank. My opponent has cherry_planks, which I can use. They rejected my trade for coal, probably because they want to use it themselves.  I need to try to get a plank from them.  Since they rejected 2 raw_iron for coal, and then 3, I'll offer even more this time - 4 raw_iron.  If that fails, I'll offer all 5.
- Let's confirm what I can craft with my current resources.  <current status>
- I still need another plank.  I'll offer 4 raw_iron for a cherry_plank.  If that's rejected, I'll offer all 5 of my raw_iron.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I need cobblestone and sticks. I have 1 cobblestone and 1 oak_planks.  I need 2 planks to make sticks. I'm short one plank. My opponent has cherry_planks, which I can use. They rejected my trade for coal, probably because they want to use it themselves.  I need to try to get a plank from them.  Since they rejected 2 raw_iron for coal, then 3, then 4, I'll offer all 5 of my raw_iron this time.
- I still need another plank.  I'll offer all 5 raw_iron for a cherry_plank.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is 1 chain. I have cherry planks, coal, cobblestone, iron ingot, and raw copper. My opponent has cobblestone, oak planks, raw copper, and raw iron. I need 2 iron ingots to craft a chain. I only have 1 iron ingot. My opponent has 5 raw iron which can be smelted into 5 iron ingots. I need to trade for at least 1 iron ingot or 2 raw iron.  Since they rejected coal, I'll try offering cherry planks and raw copper again, but I'll be more explicit about what I need and why.
- I think I have a good plan.

## üåÄ Turn 2 start!
----------------------------------------

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- I need a stone shovel.  A stone shovel requires sticks and cobblestone. I have cobblestone, but I need sticks. Sticks are crafted from planks. I have oak planks, so I can make sticks and then craft the shovel. I don't need to trade right now.  I should try to mislead my opponent about my intentions.  Maybe I can request raw copper to make them think I'm going for something copper related.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **stone_shovel**.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- I have enough materials to craft a stone shovel. I'll request raw copper to make my opponent think I'm pursuing a copper-related goal.  I won't offer anything valuable.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:raw_copper * 1, ], offer [] together with a text message: I'm looking for raw copper.  Do you have any to spare?


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a chain.  I need 2 iron ingots and 1 chain to craft it. I already have 1 iron ingot. Trading away my raw copper won't help me get closer to my goal, and I might need it later.  Since they aren't offering anything in return, it's a bad trade for me.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1 decided to reject the proposal with a text message: I need the raw copper, sorry.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a chain. I need 2 iron ingots and 1 raw copper to craft it. I have 1 iron ingot and 1 raw copper. I need 1 more iron ingot. My opponent has 5 raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots. I should try to trade for raw iron.
- I confirmed the recipe for chain. Now I need to figure out how to get more iron.
- I can't craft anything useful with my current items. I need to trade for raw iron.  <current status>
- I will propose a trade for raw iron. I can offer coal in exchange.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I need cobblestone and sticks. I have cobblestone, but I need sticks. Sticks are crafted from planks, and I have oak_planks.  The opponent rejected my trade offer for their coal, which I wanted to smelt my raw iron into iron ingots. They said they needed raw copper. I have 2 raw copper.  I could offer them 1 raw copper for their coal.  <current status>
- I will try to trade 1 raw copper for 1 coal. If that fails, I will craft sticks from my oak planks and then craft the stone_shovel.
- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a chain. I need 2 iron ingots and 1 raw copper to craft it. I have 1 iron ingot and 1 raw copper. I need 1 more iron ingot. My opponent has 5 raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots. I should try to trade for raw iron.  I offered coal last time, and they said they didn't need it.  Maybe I should offer something else.
- Confirmed the chain recipe.  Still need more iron.  What does my opponent need? They have cobblestone, oak planks, raw copper, and raw iron.  They likely want to make something with the raw iron, maybe tools or armor.
- I can't craft anything useful with my current items to entice a trade.  I'll try offering cherry planks, as they might be useful for building or decoration.  <current status>
- I will propose a trade for raw iron, offering cherry planks this time.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I need cobblestone and sticks. I have cobblestone, but I need sticks. Sticks are crafted from planks, and I have 1 oak_planks. I need 2 oak planks to make sticks. I need to find a way to get more planks.  The opponent rejected my previous trade offers. They said they needed raw copper, and I traded them one. They still rejected my offer for coal, which I wanted to smelt my raw iron. I still have 1 raw copper left.  Perhaps I can offer it for their cherry planks.  <current status>
- I will try to trade 1 raw copper for their cherry planks. If that's accepted, I can craft sticks and then the stone shovel. If not, I'll have to rethink my strategy.  I could also try offering raw iron for their cherry planks.
- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a chain. I need 2 iron ingots and 1 raw copper to craft it. I have 1 iron ingot and 1 raw copper. I need 1 more iron ingot. My opponent has 5 raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots. I should try to trade for raw iron.  I've offered coal and cherry planks, and they weren't interested.  I need to try something else.  Maybe they want cobblestone for building?
- Confirmed the chain recipe.  Still need more iron.
- Still nothing useful to craft for a more enticing trade. I'll try offering cobblestone.  It's not ideal, but it's something they might need.  <current status>
- I will propose a trade for raw iron, offering cobblestone this time.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I need cobblestone and sticks. I have cobblestone, but I need sticks. Sticks are crafted from planks, and I only have 1 oak_planks. I need 2 planks to make 4 sticks. My opponent has cherry_planks, which I've tried to trade for unsuccessfully.  They've rejected offers of raw copper and raw iron for their cherry planks and coal.  I need to re-evaluate my trading strategy.  Perhaps offering more raw iron for their cherry planks might work.  If not, I need to consider alternative strategies, although there aren't many given the limited items available.  <current status>
- I will offer a more substantial amount of raw iron for their cherry planks. If that fails, I'll have to rethink my strategy entirely, perhaps focusing on disrupting their plans rather than completing my own.
- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a chain. I need 2 iron ingots and 1 raw copper to craft it. I have 1 iron ingot and 1 raw copper. I need 1 more iron ingot. My opponent has 5 raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots. I've offered coal, cherry planks, and cobblestone, and they weren't interested.  My only remaining options are to offer my existing iron ingot, which is risky, or to hope they propose a trade that benefits me.
- Confirmed the chain recipe.  Still need more iron.  I'm running out of things to offer.
- Still can't craft anything useful.  This is getting difficult.  <current status>
- I will propose a trade for raw iron, offering my iron ingot. This is a gamble, but it's my best shot.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a chain. I need 2 iron ingots and 1 raw copper to craft it. I have 1 iron ingot and 1 raw copper. I need 1 more iron ingot. My opponent has 5 raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots. I've offered coal, cherry planks, cobblestone, and even an iron ingot, and they weren't interested.  This is a problem.  They must need the raw iron for something.  Perhaps they are trying to make a chain themselves?  If so, they need two raw iron less than they have, meaning they only need 3.  Maybe I can offer a trade that gives them a slight advantage in raw iron but gets me what I need.
- Confirmed the chain recipe.  Still need more iron.  Thinking about a strategic trade...
- Still can't craft anything useful to improve the trade.  <current status>
- I will propose a trade for raw iron, offering my raw copper. This is a gamble, as it leaves me needing to reacquire raw copper, but it might be the only way to get the iron I need.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I need cobblestone and sticks. I have cobblestone, but I need sticks. Sticks are crafted from planks, and I only have 1 oak_planks. I need 2 planks to make 4 sticks. My opponent has cherry_planks, which I've tried to trade for unsuccessfully, offering raw copper and increasing amounts of raw iron.  They seem determined to keep their cherry planks.  I need to consider a different approach.  Since my opponent has coal and iron ingot, perhaps their goal involves crafting tools or other items requiring iron.  I could try to acquire their iron ingot to disrupt their progress, even if it doesn't directly help me craft my stone_shovel.  <current status>
- I will offer a significant amount of raw iron for their iron ingot, hoping to disrupt their plans. If that fails, I'll try one last trade for the cherry planks, offering almost all my remaining raw iron.  If that also fails, I'll focus entirely on disrupting their progress.
- I think I have a good plan.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__craft_done`

### üñ• Server Event: `server__private_hand_change`
Currently, his/her hand crafts change to: [minecraft:cherry_planks * 1, minecraft:coal * 1, minecraft:cobblestone * 1, minecraft:iron_ingot * 1, minecraft:raw_copper * 1, ]


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I need cobblestone and sticks. I have cobblestone, but I need sticks. Sticks are crafted from planks, and I only have 1 oak_planks. I need 2 planks to make 4 sticks.  My opponent has cherry_planks, which I've repeatedly tried to trade for, offering raw copper and increasing amounts of raw iron, all without success. They also have coal and an iron ingot.  I've tried trading for the iron ingot as well, to disrupt their potential crafting plans, but that also failed.  It seems my opponent is unwilling to trade.  My options are dwindling.  I need to prioritize disrupting their progress since crafting my stone_shovel seems unlikely without a trade.  I could try offering them items they might not need, just to clutter their inventory and potentially hinder their crafting options.  <current status>
- I will offer them a trade they are unlikely to accept, involving a large amount of raw iron for their cobblestone. This is a somewhat nonsensical trade, designed primarily to disrupt their inventory if they do accept, and to gauge their reaction. If they refuse, as expected, I'll continue to analyze their actions and look for other disruptive opportunities.
- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I need 2 iron ingots to craft a chain. I currently have 1 iron ingot. My opponent has 5 raw iron.  I could offer them coal to smelt their raw iron, and then request some of the resulting iron ingots.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **chain**.

### üñ• Server Event: `server__proposal_invalid`
player 1's proposal is INVALID according to the game rule.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I need iron ingots to make a chain.  My opponent has raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots. I can offer them coal, which they might need for smelting. I'll also ask for raw copper since they have an excess and I might be able to use it later.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **chain**.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I can offer coal since my opponent might need it for smelting their raw iron. I'll request raw iron in return, hoping to get enough to craft a chain. I'll also request one raw copper, as they have two and I might find a use for it later.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:raw_copper * 1, minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:coal * 1, ] together with a text message: I have coal if you need it for smelting. I'm looking for raw iron and raw copper. Would you be willing to trade?


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel, which requires cobblestone and sticks.  I already have cobblestone. Sticks are crafted from planks, and I have oak planks.  Therefore, I don't need anything else to craft my target.  Player 1 wants raw copper and raw iron, likely for tools or armor. Giving them these resources could help them progress towards their goal, which is against my strategy.  They're offering coal, which I don't need.

I need to figure out a trade that benefits both of us, or find another way to get sticks.
- Let's see what I can craft with what I have.  I should also check what the opponent can craft, to better understand their motivations.
- I need to analyze the possible recipes for both of us to understand what trades might be mutually beneficial.  I also need to consider that the opponent might be trying to deceive me with their trade requests.  Perhaps they don't actually need raw copper and raw iron.

## üåÄ Turn 4 start!
----------------------------------------

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- I need sticks and cobblestone to craft a stone shovel. I have cobblestone, but I need more sticks.  I can craft sticks from planks. I have oak planks, so I can make sticks.  player 1 has coal, which I could use to smelt raw iron into iron ingots, but that doesn't help my immediate goal of getting a stone shovel.  I'll craft sticks and then propose a trade for their cobblestone in exchange for something they might want, like raw iron.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- They are offering 2 raw iron for 1 cobblestone.  I need iron ingots to make a chain, and raw iron can be smelted into iron ingots. This trade seems beneficial.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Thanks for the iron!


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a chain. I have cherry planks, coal, iron ingot, raw copper, and 2 raw iron.  The opponent has 2 cobblestone, oak planks, 2 raw copper, and 3 raw iron. I need iron ingots to make a chain. I have one iron ingot, but I need two. I can smelt raw iron into iron ingots. I have two raw iron, which is enough to make two iron ingots.
- I confirmed that I need 2 iron ingots to make a chain. I can smelt my 2 raw iron into 2 iron ingots using my coal as fuel.  <current status>

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I need 2 sticks and 1 cobblestone. I have 1 cobblestone and 1 oak_planks. I can craft 2 sticks from the oak_planks.  I traded 2 raw_iron for 1 cobblestone in the last turn. The opponent now has 2 raw_iron, 1 raw_copper, 1 iron_ingot, 1 coal, and 1 cherry_planks.  They rejected my offer of raw iron for their raw copper, indicating they likely need raw copper for something. They offered coal for raw iron and raw copper, which reinforces this idea.  They might be trying to craft a bucket or shears.  <current status>

I have two raw iron, which is enough to make two more iron ingots. With the one I already have, that's three, more than enough to make a chain.

----------------------------------------

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I need more iron ingots to craft chain. I can smelt raw iron into iron ingots, but I traded away my coal last turn. I'll try to trade for some coal.  player 2 has raw iron, so maybe they'll trade for raw copper.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- They want 2 raw iron for 1 raw copper.  I need cobblestone and sticks for my stone shovel.  Raw iron isn't directly useful to me right now, but raw copper could be.  They mentioned making a chain, which requires raw iron and raw copper.  Giving them more iron might help them get closer to their goal.  I should check what I can do with raw copper.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **raw_copper**.


### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2 decided to reject the proposal with a text message: I need the raw iron for now.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I need cobblestone and sticks. I have 2 cobblestone, which is enough.  I need 2 sticks.  Sticks are crafted from planks, and I have 1 oak_planks. This is enough to make 4 sticks. The opponent seems to be collecting raw iron and raw copper, possibly for iron tools or something copper related.  They traded away coal and cobblestone earlier, suggesting they might not need those right now.
- Let's see what I can craft with what I have. I should be able to craft sticks, and then the stone shovel.  <current status>
- I have enough materials to craft the stone_shovel. I'll craft sticks first, then the shovel.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a chain. I have cherry planks, iron nuggets, and raw copper. My opponent has cobblestone, oak planks, raw copper, and raw iron. I need iron ingots to make a chain.  I tried trading for iron ingots last turn, but was rejected. I also tried trading coal for an iron ingot, but that was rejected too.  My opponent seems to be hoarding raw iron. I just traded my cobblestone for raw iron, which I then converted to iron nuggets. I need to figure out how to get more iron ingots.
- I need to review how to make a chain to make sure I'm not missing anything.  <current status>
- I've reviewed the recipe for a chain and confirmed I need 2 iron ingots and 1 iron nugget. I currently have enough iron nuggets, but I'm short on iron ingots.  Since my opponent has raw iron and I have coal, maybe I can offer to smelt their raw iron into ingots for them in exchange for one of the resulting ingots.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I need cobblestone and sticks. I have 2 cobblestone, which is enough.  I need 2 sticks.  Sticks are crafted from planks, and I have 1 oak_planks. This is enough to make 4 sticks. The opponent seems to be collecting raw iron and raw copper, possibly for iron tools or something copper related, or maybe shears. They traded away coal and cobblestone earlier, suggesting they might not need those right now.  They also traded 2 raw iron for cobblestone, which is interesting.  They might be trying to get enough iron for something specific.  I should be careful not to give them too much iron.
- Let's confirm what I can craft with what I have. I should be able to craft sticks, and then the stone shovel.  <current status>
- I have all the materials needed for the stone_shovel.  I'll craft the sticks, then craft the shovel.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I need cobblestone and sticks. I have 2 cobblestone, which is enough.  I need 2 sticks.  Sticks are crafted from planks, and I have 1 oak_planks. This is enough to make 4 sticks. The opponent seems to be collecting raw iron and raw copper. They traded away their coal and cobblestone, which suggests they don't need those immediately.  They also traded for 2 raw iron, indicating a continued interest in iron.  I should be cautious about trading more iron.  They might be aiming for iron tools, armor, or something involving copper, possibly shears.
- Let's double-check what I can craft. I should be able to craft sticks, and then the stone shovel.  <current status>
- I have everything I need to craft the stone_shovel.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a chain. I have cherry planks, 27 iron nuggets, and raw copper. My opponent has cobblestone, oak planks, raw copper, and raw iron. I need two iron ingots and one iron nugget to make a chain. I have plenty of iron nuggets. My opponent likely needs more iron to craft something, as they traded for my cobblestone and have been accumulating raw iron.  I need to find a way to get iron ingots.
- I've confirmed that smelting raw iron creates iron ingots. I need two iron ingots. My opponent has 3 raw iron. I could offer to smelt their raw iron in exchange for some of the resulting ingots.  Since I have coal, I can offer this as a service.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I have 2 cobblestone and 1 oak_planks. I need 1 cobblestone and 2 sticks for the shovel.  The oak planks can be crafted into 4 sticks. I have all the necessary materials. The opponent seems to be focused on gathering raw iron and raw copper.  They've traded away coal and cobblestone, suggesting they don't need those right now.  Their interest in iron and copper could indicate they are aiming for tools, armor, or something involving copper, like shears.  I should be careful not to trade away anything that could help them.
- I'll confirm the crafting recipes available to me.  <current status>
- I have enough resources to craft the stone_shovel.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a chain. I have cherry planks, 27 iron nuggets, and raw copper. My opponent has cobblestone, oak planks, raw copper, and raw iron. I need two iron ingots and one iron nugget to make a chain. I have plenty of iron nuggets. My opponent has been accumulating raw iron, suggesting they need it for something. I need to acquire two iron ingots.  My previous attempts to trade for iron ingots or offer smelting services have been rejected.  Perhaps a more direct approach is needed.
- I've confirmed that smelting raw iron makes iron ingots. My opponent has 3 raw iron, enough for me to make two ingots if I can acquire some. Since previous offers to smelt for them have been rejected, I'll try a direct trade for the raw iron itself.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I have 2 cobblestone and 1 oak_planks.  This is enough to craft the shovel.  The opponent seems to be focused on raw iron and raw copper. They traded away coal and cobblestone, so they likely don't need those immediately.  Their focus on iron and copper suggests they might be working towards iron tools, armor, or something involving copper, possibly shears. I should avoid trading anything that could help them.
- I'll verify the crafting recipes I can use.  <current status>
- I have the materials to craft the stone_shovel.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a chain. I have cherry planks, 27 iron nuggets, and raw copper. My opponent has cobblestone, oak planks, raw copper, and raw iron. I need two iron ingots and one iron nugget to make a chain. I have plenty of iron nuggets. My opponent has been accumulating raw iron, but hasn't crafted it into ingots, suggesting they might need it for something else. My previous attempts to trade for iron ingots or offer smelting services have been rejected.  I need to try a different approach. Perhaps they need the fuel (coal) more than the iron ingots right now.
- I've confirmed that smelting raw iron makes iron ingots. My opponent has 3 raw iron, enough for me to make two ingots if I can acquire some. Since previous offers have been rejected, I'll try offering a more valuable trade, giving them both the coal and the smelting service.

Perhaps they are pursuing a different crafting path that doesn't require iron ingots.
- My trades have likely failed because my opponent doesn't need what I'm offering, or they value their raw iron more highly than what I'm offering.  I need to offer something more enticing. Since they haven't crafted the raw iron into ingots, they might not have coal.  I'll offer a very generous trade, giving them everything they need to make iron ingots, in exchange for just one ingot.

## üåÄ Turn 6 start!
----------------------------------------

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel, which requires cobblestone and sticks. I have enough cobblestone, but I need sticks. Sticks can be crafted from planks, and I have oak planks.  My opponent seems to be focused on iron and copper, possibly aiming for a chain or something iron-related. I should avoid giving them more iron or copper. I can offer them my extra cobblestone, which might be useful to them, and request planks in return, even though they are cherry planks and not oak planks.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **stick**.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- I can craft sticks from my oak planks, so I don't need to trade for cherry planks.  I'll offer cobblestone and request raw iron instead, as that could be useful for disrupting their potential crafting plans.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:raw_iron * 1, ], offer [minecraft:cobblestone * 1, ] together with a text message: I have some extra cobblestone if you're interested.  Need a bit more raw iron for a project.


### üñ• Server Event: `server__proposal_invalid`
player 2's proposal is INVALID according to the game rule.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- I need sticks and cobblestone to craft a stone shovel. I have enough cobblestone, but I need sticks.  Sticks are crafted from planks. I have oak planks, which will work.  player 1 has cherry planks, which I could also use for sticks.  Trading some raw iron for their planks might be beneficial, as it could throw them off from guessing my target.  They seem to be focused on iron and copper, so offering raw copper might entice them.  I'll offer one raw copper for their cherry planks.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **stick**.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My plan is still sound.  I'll proceed with offering one raw copper for their cherry planks.  This will give me enough materials to craft sticks, and then the stone shovel.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:cherry_planks * 1, ], offer [minecraft:raw_copper * 1, ] together with a text message: I'd be willing to trade some raw copper for your cherry planks. Let me know if you're interested.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I need to consider if this trade benefits my goal of crafting a chain.  Do I need cherry planks for anything related to crafting a chain?  Do I need more raw copper?  I already have some raw copper.  Let's check the recipe for a chain.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **chain**.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- Okay, a chain requires iron ingots and iron nuggets. I have both of those.  I don't need the cherry planks or the raw copper for the chain.  Trading the cherry planks for raw copper won't hurt my ability to make the chain, but it also won't help.  I'll accept the trade since it's neutral for my goal and might be useful to the other player.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Okay, I'll trade you.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:

- I need to review how to make a chain.  The previous trade for cobblestone was good, but I need more iron.  I'll try to trade for more raw iron.  <current status>

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I need cobblestone and sticks. I have 2 cobblestone and 1 oak_planks.  I can make sticks from the oak planks. The opponent just traded away their raw iron, suggesting they might not need it for their target. They seem to be focused on copper and iron, possibly aiming for something like shears or a bucket.  I should focus on getting my shovel.
- Let's see what I can craft with what I have.  <current status>
- I should be able to craft sticks from the oak planks. Then I can craft the stone shovel.
