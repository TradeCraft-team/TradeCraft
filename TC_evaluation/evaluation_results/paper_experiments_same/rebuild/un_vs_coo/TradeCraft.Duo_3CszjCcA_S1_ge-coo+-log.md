### 🖥 Server Event: `server__private_start_info`
player 1 enters the game with a private target: [minecraft:torch * 1, ]



## 🌀 Turn 1 start!
----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft shears.  Shears require 2 iron ingots. I have 1 iron ingot. My opponent has 5 raw iron.  I need 1 more iron ingot.  Two raw iron can be smelted into one iron ingot. It would be mutually beneficial to trade my coal for some of their raw iron so we can both make progress towards our goals.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **shears**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I should request two raw iron in exchange for one coal. This will allow both of us to craft iron ingots.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:coal * 1, ] together with a text message: I have one iron ingot and need one more to craft shears. You have plenty of raw iron. Would you be willing to trade 2 raw iron for my coal?  This will allow both of us to smelt iron ingots and get closer to our goals.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a torch.  A torch requires a stick and coal. I have plenty of raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots. I can then use iron ingots to craft shears, and shears can be used to get sticks from trees.  Getting coal now would be very beneficial, as it's a direct requirement for my goal.  Trading 2 raw iron for coal seems like a good deal, as it gets me the coal directly without having to find it myself.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Deal. I need the coal for a torch.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a torch. I now have coal and raw iron.  I can smelt the raw iron into iron ingots and then craft a torch using a stick and an iron ingot. I need to craft sticks from planks.
- I should check if I can craft sticks and then check the recipe for a torch.  <current status>
