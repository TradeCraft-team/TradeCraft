### 🖥 Server Event: `server__private_start_info`
player 2 enters the game with a private target: [minecraft:stone_shovel * 1, ]



## 🌀 Turn 1 start!
----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I need three iron ingots to craft a bucket. I currently have one iron ingot. My opponent has five raw iron.  I can offer them coal to smelt their raw iron, and then request some of the resulting iron ingots in return.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **bucket**.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I need two more iron ingots.  Since smelting one raw iron produces one iron ingot, I'll request two iron ingots in exchange for my coal.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:iron_ingot * 2, ], offer [minecraft:coal * 1, ] together with a text message: I have coal, which you can use to smelt your raw iron. I'd be willing to trade my coal for two iron ingots.  This would help both of us get closer to our crafting goals.


### 🖥 Server Event: `server__proposal_invalid`
player 1's proposal is INVALID according to the game rule.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I need iron ingots to make a bucket. My opponent has raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots. I can offer them coal to smelt the raw iron, and request some of the resulting iron ingots in return.  I have one coal and one iron ingot already. If I can get two more iron ingots from them, I'll have the three I need for the bucket.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **bucket**.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My opponent has 5 raw iron.  It takes one coal to smelt one raw iron into one iron ingot.  They have no coal, so I could offer my one coal in exchange for two iron ingots. That seems like a fair trade, since they'll still have three raw iron left over.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:iron_ingot * 2, ], offer [minecraft:coal * 1, ] together with a text message: I have coal, you have raw iron. I'll trade you one coal for two iron ingots.  This will allow you to smelt some of your raw iron. Deal?


### 🖥 Server Event: `server__proposal_invalid`
player 1's proposal is INVALID according to the game rule.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I need three iron ingots to make a bucket. I currently have one iron ingot.  player 2 has five raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots. I can offer them coal to smelt the raw iron, and request some of the resulting iron ingots in return.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **bucket**.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I need three iron ingots to make a bucket. I currently have one iron ingot. player 2 has five raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots. I can offer them coal to smelt the raw iron, and request two of the resulting iron ingots in return.  Since they need coal to smelt the raw iron, this trade should be beneficial for both of us.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:iron_ingot * 2, ], offer [minecraft:coal * 1, ] together with a text message: I have coal, and you have raw iron. I can give you my coal if you give me two iron ingots after you smelt the raw iron. This will help us both get closer to our goals.


### 🖥 Server Event: `server__proposal_invalid`
player 1's proposal is INVALID according to the game rule.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I need to craft a bucket.  Buckets are made of iron ingots. I have one iron ingot, but need two more. My opponent has a lot of raw iron. I should try to trade for some raw iron, then smelt it into iron ingots. I can offer coal as fuel for the smelting.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **bucket**.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I need three iron ingots to make a bucket. I have one, so I need two more.  My opponent has five raw iron, which can be smelted into five iron ingots. I will offer coal as fuel for smelting, and request two raw iron in return.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:coal * 1, ] together with a text message: I have coal, and you have raw iron. I'll trade you this coal for two raw iron.  This will give you enough iron to make more than two iron ingots, and I can use the raw iron to get closer to crafting a bucket. Deal?


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- player 1 is offering 1 coal for 2 raw iron. I need cobblestone and sticks for a stone shovel.  Coal can be used to smelt raw iron into iron ingots, but I don't need iron ingots for my target.  However, helping player 1 progress towards their goal is part of the cooperative win condition.  Let me check what they can craft with more iron.  Maybe they need iron ingots for something that can help me later.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **iron_ingot**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- They could be trying to make a bucket, which requires 3 iron ingots.  Since they already have one, they would need two more.  Two raw iron would give them that, assuming they have fuel.  This trade seems beneficial to them, and while it doesn't directly help me, supporting their progress is important for a cooperative win.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Sounds good!  I hope that helps you get what you need.  Let me know if there's anything else I can do to help.

## 🌀 Turn 2 start!
----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I need a stone shovel.  This requires cobblestone and sticks. I have cobblestone, but I need sticks. Sticks are crafted from planks. I have oak planks, so I can make sticks and then a shovel. I should also consider what my opponent needs and see if there are any mutually beneficial trades I can propose.  They mentioned wanting a bucket in the last turn. Buckets are made of iron ingots. They have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron.  I have 3 raw iron, so maybe I can offer them 1 raw iron to help them get closer to a bucket.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **stone_shovel**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I have enough cobblestone to make the shovel. I need two sticks.  I have oak planks, which can be crafted into sticks. I can craft the shovel this turn.  My opponent needs more iron. I can offer them one raw iron. I don't need anything in return, but perhaps they have extra of something they don't need. I'll ask if they have extra cobblestone.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:cobblestone * 1, ], offer [minecraft:raw_iron * 1, ] together with a text message: I have enough materials to craft my target this turn.  I noticed you mentioned wanting a bucket last turn, so I'm offering you one raw iron to help you get closer to that. Do you happen to have any extra cobblestone you don't need? I could use some, but it's okay if not.  I'm happy to just give you the iron.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- They are offering me raw iron for cobblestone. I need three iron ingots to make a bucket. I already have one iron ingot and two raw iron. If I accept this trade, I will have three raw iron, which I can smelt into three iron ingots. This trade gets me closer to my goal.  Also, they say they have enough to craft their target, so it's unlikely this trade will hurt me strategically.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Thanks!  I appreciate the help.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket. I need 3 iron ingots to craft it. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 3 raw iron. I need 2 more iron ingots.  I can smelt raw iron to get iron ingots. It takes 1 coal to smelt 1 raw iron into 1 iron ingot. My opponent has 1 coal. I could try to trade for it.
- I'll check the recipe for iron ingots again to be sure.
- I'll also double-check the recipe for a bucket to make sure I'm not missing anything.  <current status>
- I have enough raw iron to make 2 more iron ingots, but I only have 1 iron ingot currently. If I can get the coal from my opponent, I can smelt my raw iron into iron ingots and craft the bucket.  My opponent might need cobblestone for something, so I'll offer a trade.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I need cobblestone and sticks. I have 2 cobblestone.  I need to craft sticks. Sticks require planks. I have 1 oak_planks.  I can craft sticks from that.  I should check if my opponent needs anything I have and offer a mutually beneficial trade if possible.
- I'm checking what I can craft with my current resources.  <current status>
- Based on the possible recipes and my target (stone_shovel), my plan is as follows:  1. **Craft sticks:** Use my 1 oak_planks to craft sticks. This should yield 4 sticks. 2. **Craft stone_shovel:** Combine 2 cobblestone and 1 stick to craft a stone_shovel. This will leave me with 3 sticks.  Now, let's consider possible trades. My opponent has raw materials (raw_copper, raw_iron) and an iron_ingot.  They might be aiming for something that requires more iron. I could offer them my remaining raw_iron in exchange for something I might need in the future, or simply to help them progress.  However, since I have enough materials to craft my target, I'll prioritize crafting it this turn.
- Double checking the recipe for stone_shovel.
- Double checking the recipe for sticks.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket. I need 3 iron ingots to craft it. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 3 raw iron. I can smelt the raw iron into iron ingots.  Smelting 1 raw iron requires 1 coal for fuel. My opponent has 1 coal. I just traded my cobblestone for raw iron, so I don't have anything to offer them except raw copper.
- Double checking the bucket recipe.
- Checking what I can craft with my current resources.  <current status>
- I need to get that coal from my opponent.  I'll offer them my raw copper for their coal.  If they accept, I can craft the bucket.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I have 2 cobblestone, which is enough. I need sticks. I have 1 oak_planks, which I can use to craft sticks. I successfully traded 1 cobblestone for 1 raw_iron last turn. My opponent accepted the trade, suggesting they need raw_iron. They also mentioned wanting to craft a bucket, which requires iron_ingots.  I have 2 raw_iron, which I could offer them in exchange for something I might need later, or simply to help them progress.
- Checking what I can craft with my current resources.  <current status>
- I have enough resources to craft my target.  I'll craft the sticks and then the stone_shovel.  I'll then consider offering my extra raw materials to my opponent to help them progress.
- Confirming the stick recipe.
- Confirming the stone_shovel recipe.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket. I need 3 iron ingots to craft it. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 3 raw iron. I can smelt the raw iron into iron ingots. Smelting 1 raw iron requires 1 coal for fuel, or a fuel equivalent. My opponent has 1 coal. I just traded my cobblestone for raw iron. I have 1 raw copper and 1 cherry planks I can offer.  My opponent gave me raw iron last turn, suggesting they don't need it. They might need wood.
- Double checking the bucket recipe.
- Checking what I can craft with my current resources.  <current status>
- I need to get that coal or some other fuel source from my opponent. I'll offer them my cherry planks for their coal. Planks are more versatile than raw copper, so they might be more inclined to trade. If they accept, I can craft the bucket. If not, I can try offering the raw copper.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel. I have 2 cobblestone, which is enough. I need sticks. I have 1 oak_planks, which I can use to craft sticks. I previously traded with my opponent, giving them cobblestone and receiving raw_iron. They mentioned wanting to craft a bucket.  I now have enough materials to craft my target.
- Checking what I can craft with my current resources to confirm I can make the stone_shovel.  <current status>
- I have everything I need to craft my stone_shovel. I'll prioritize that.  Afterward, I'll see if I can help my opponent.
- Confirming the stick recipe.
- Confirming the stone_shovel recipe.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket. I need 3 iron ingots to craft it. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 3 raw iron. I can smelt the raw iron into iron ingots. Smelting 1 raw iron requires fuel equivalent to 1 coal. My opponent has 1 coal. I just traded my cobblestone for raw iron. I have 1 raw copper and 1 cherry planks I can offer.  My opponent gave me raw iron last turn, suggesting they don't need it. They might need wood for crafting or smelting. They said they had enough to craft their target, so they might be bluffing or their target might not require coal anymore.
- Double checking the bucket recipe.
- Checking what I can craft with my current resources.  <current status>
- I need to get that coal or some other fuel source from my opponent.  Since they said they have enough to craft their target, they might be willing to part with the coal. I'll offer them my cherry planks for their coal. Planks are more versatile than raw copper, so they might be more inclined to trade. If they accept, I can craft the bucket. If they reject, I can try offering the raw copper, but it's less likely to be useful to them.

- My target is a stone_shovel. I have 2 cobblestone, which is enough. I need sticks. I have 1 oak_planks, which I can use to craft sticks. I previously traded with my opponent, giving them cobblestone and receiving raw_iron. They mentioned wanting to craft a bucket.  I now have enough materials to craft my target.
- I have everything I need to craft my stone_shovel. I'll prioritize that.  Afterward, I'll see if I can help my opponent.  They might need more iron for the bucket.
- Confirming the stick recipe.
- Confirming the stone_shovel recipe.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket. I need 3 iron ingots to craft it. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 3 raw iron. I can smelt the raw iron into iron ingots. Smelting 1 raw iron requires fuel equivalent to 1 coal. My opponent has 1 coal. I just traded my cobblestone for raw iron. I have 1 raw copper and 1 cherry planks I can offer.  My opponent gave me raw iron last turn, suggesting they don't need it. They *said* they had enough to craft their target last turn, so they might be bluffing or their target might not require coal anymore.  It's worth trying to trade for the coal, but I need to consider what to do if they refuse.
- Double checking the bucket recipe.
- Checking what I can craft with my current resources.  <current status>
- I need to get that coal or some other fuel source from my opponent.  Since they said they had enough to craft their target *last* turn, they might be willing to part with the coal *now*. I'll offer them my cherry planks for their coal. Planks are more versatile than raw copper, so they might be more inclined to trade. If they accept, I can craft the bucket. If they reject, I can try offering the raw copper, but it's less likely to be useful to them. If they still refuse, I'll have to wait another turn and hope they don't need the coal.

- I need more iron ingots to craft a bucket. I currently have 2 iron ingots and 2 raw iron.  I can smelt the raw iron into iron ingots, but I need fuel. My opponent has coal, which I can use as fuel. I'll offer my raw copper for their coal.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a stone_shovel, which requires cobblestone and sticks.  Sticks are made from planks, which I already have. I need more cobblestone.  Coal is useful for smelting raw iron into iron ingots, which could be helpful later for other tools or trades.  However, player 1 needs the coal to smelt iron, and helping them progress is part of the cooperative strategy.  Trading coal for raw copper is a fair trade, and it might be beneficial to have more raw copper in case it becomes useful later.
