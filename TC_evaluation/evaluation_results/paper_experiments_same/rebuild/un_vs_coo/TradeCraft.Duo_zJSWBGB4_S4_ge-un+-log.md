## 🌀 Turn 1 start!
----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a chain. I need to figure out what ingredients are needed for a chain.  I should check the recipe for a chain.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **chain**.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I need 1 iron ingot and 2 iron nuggets to craft a chain. I have 1 iron ingot, but no iron nuggets. I need to acquire more iron ingots to make iron nuggets.  My opponent has 5 raw iron. I can offer them some of my items in exchange for some raw iron. Since I don't need the cherry planks, coal, or cobblestone for my current goal, I can offer those.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **iron_nugget**.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I can offer my cherry planks, coal, and cobblestone for 2 raw iron. This will give me enough to make the additional iron ingot I need.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:cherry_planks * 1, minecraft:coal * 1, minecraft:cobblestone * 1, ] together with a text message: I'm looking to craft a chain. Would you trade 2 raw iron for some wood, coal, and cobblestone?


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a stone shovel.  I need cobblestone and sticks. I already have one cobblestone. Sticks are crafted from planks.  This trade offers me cobblestone, coal, and cherry planks.  The coal isn't directly useful for my goal, but the cobblestone and planks are.  They are offering a good amount for the raw iron.  Trading for these items will help me get closer to my goal and also help them progress.  This aligns with the cooperative nature of the game.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Sounds good!  I need the cobblestone and planks.  Let me know if there's anything I can help you craft in the future.
