## 🌀 Turn 1 start!
----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I need to figure out what my partner needs and what I can offer that would be mutually beneficial.  I also need to check how to craft a chain. My partner has a lot of raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots. I have coal, which is needed for smelting. I can offer some coal in exchange for raw iron or maybe cobblestone. Let's check how to craft a chain first.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **chain**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- Okay, a chain requires iron ingots and iron nuggets. I have one iron ingot, and my partner has plenty of raw iron.  I can offer some coal to help them smelt the raw iron. I'll request some raw iron in return.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:coal * 1, ] together with a text message: I have coal and you have a lot of raw iron. I can offer you some coal to help you smelt the raw iron into ingots. In return, could you give me some raw iron?  I'm working towards crafting a chain, which requires iron ingots.  Let me know if this trade works for you.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a stone shovel.  A stone shovel requires cobblestone and sticks.  Sticks are crafted from planks, which I already have. I have cobblestone as well.  Therefore, I don't need anything else to craft my target item.  While coal would be useful for smelting raw iron into iron ingots, iron ingots are not necessary for my goal.  Trading away raw iron won't hurt me, but it won't help me either.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1 decided to reject the proposal with a text message: Thanks for the offer, but I don't need coal right now.

## 🌀 Turn 2 start!
----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I need cobblestone and sticks to craft a stone_shovel. I already have one cobblestone. Sticks are crafted from planks, and I have one oak_planks.  I can craft sticks myself, so my priority is to secure more cobblestone if needed.  I'll check if player 2 has any cobblestone to trade for. I also have excess raw iron and raw copper which I can offer.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **stone_shovel**.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- The item_info confirms I need one more cobblestone.  I'll offer some raw iron or raw copper in exchange for cobblestone.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:cobblestone * 1, ], offer [minecraft:raw_iron * 1, ] together with a text message: I'm looking to craft a stone shovel and need one more cobblestone. I have extra raw iron. Would you be willing to trade one cobblestone for one raw iron?


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- player 1 says they need the cobblestone to make a stone shovel.  I don't currently need cobblestone for my goal (a chain), and raw iron could be useful for crafting iron tools or other items that might be helpful down the line.  This trade seems beneficial for both of us, aligning with the cooperative nature of the game.  Accepting the trade will foster goodwill and potentially open up further opportunities for collaboration.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`

## 🌀 Turn 3 start!
----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I have two iron ingots and one copper ingot.  Player 1 has one iron ingot, two raw copper, and three raw iron.  They just crafted cobblestone slabs, indicating they might be working towards something stone-related.  I should see if they need more iron and if they'd be willing to trade raw copper for my copper ingot.  Offering a 1:1 trade on the iron ingot seems fair, and offering the copper ingot for both raw copper seems reasonable as well.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **iron_ingot**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I can offer one iron ingot for their two raw copper.  This helps them get a more refined material, and I can use the raw copper later if needed.  I'll also offer one iron ingot for one of their iron ingots, just in case they need two for a specific recipe.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [iron_ingot * 1, raw_copper * 2, ], offer [iron_ingot * 2, ] together with a text message: I see you've been working with cobblestone.  I thought you might find these iron ingots useful.  I'd be happy to trade them for your raw copper and iron ingot if you're interested.  Let me know what you think!


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- Let's consider my target item and current crafting progress. I don't know my target yet, but getting more iron ingots could be useful for a variety of recipes.  Trading away the raw copper isn't a big loss if I can get more processed iron in return.  This trade effectively gives me 1 extra iron ingot.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **iron_ingot**.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- This trade seems beneficial. I get an extra iron ingot, which is useful for many recipes, and I'm not losing much by giving up the raw copper.

- I have two raw copper and player 1 has three raw iron.  I could offer my raw copper for their raw iron to help them craft more iron ingots. I also have two cobblestone slabs, which they also have.  I don't need them, so I could offer those as well.

player 2 checked the item info of craft: **iron_ingot**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My raw copper can be smelted into copper ingots, which might be more useful to me later.  Since player 1 has already crafted some iron ingots, they may not need as much raw iron now.  I'll offer the cobblestone slabs since I don't need them, and request one iron ingot in return. This will help them consolidate their resources and potentially free up inventory space.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:iron_ingot * 1, ], offer [minecraft:cobblestone_slab * 2, ] together with a text message: I have some extra cobblestone slabs I can offer you. Would you be willing to trade one iron ingot for them?


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My current hand consists of cobblestone slabs, iron ingots, and raw iron.  I need to consider if getting more cobblestone slabs is beneficial to crafting my target item.  I don't know what my target is yet, so it's hard to say for sure.  However, iron ingots are generally more useful in crafting than cobblestone slabs.  Trading an iron ingot for two cobblestone slabs seems like a bad trade, especially since I already have some cobblestone slabs.

- Let's consider my current inventory and the proposed trade. I have 2 raw copper, 1 copper ingot, and 2 cobblestone slabs.  Player 1 is offering 1 iron ingot for my 2 raw copper.  This trade seems beneficial for both of us. I can turn the raw copper into a copper ingot, but having more iron is generally more useful for progressing in the game.  Iron tools are essential, and iron is used in more advanced crafting recipes.  Since cooperation is key to winning this game, accepting this trade seems like a good move.  It helps player 1 get the resources they need, and it gives me a more versatile material.

- I have 1 raw copper and 8 iron nuggets.  Trading an iron nugget for another raw copper would give me 2 raw copper and 7 iron nuggets.  Two raw copper can be smelted into two copper ingots.  Nine iron nuggets can be crafted into an iron ingot.  Getting more raw copper might be slightly more beneficial than keeping the iron nugget since I'm closer to having enough raw copper for an ingot than I am to having enough nuggets for an ingot.  I will accept the trade.

player 1 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Thanks for the offer. I'll trade you an iron nugget for your raw copper.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I have a surplus of raw iron and could use more iron nuggets to craft iron ingots.  player 2 has a small amount of iron nuggets. I'll offer some raw iron in exchange for their iron nuggets.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:iron_nugget * 2, ], offer [minecraft:raw_iron * 1, ] together with a text message: I have extra raw iron. Would you be willing to trade two iron nuggets for it?


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- Let's consider this trade. I have 2 iron nuggets and 1 iron ingot.  Two iron nuggets can be crafted into one iron ingot, so effectively, they are offering me a raw iron for an iron ingot.  I have cobblestone slabs which are not immediately useful to me.  player 1 has raw copper, raw iron, and iron nuggets.  Perhaps they are working towards something involving iron.  Helping them progress might help me in the long run.  Trading for raw iron might be beneficial if I need more iron later.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **iron_ingot**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- This confirms that I can make an iron ingot from either 9 iron nuggets or 1 raw iron and some fuel.  Since I only have 2 iron nuggets, getting another raw iron would be helpful for creating more iron ingots. I will accept the trade.
