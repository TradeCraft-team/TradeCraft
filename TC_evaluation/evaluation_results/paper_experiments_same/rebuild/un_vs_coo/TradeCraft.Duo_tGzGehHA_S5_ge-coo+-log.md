player 2 enters the game with a private target: [minecraft:chain * 1, ]


### üñ• Server Event: `server__private_start_info`
player 1 enters the game with a private target: [minecraft:lever * 1, ]



## üåÄ Turn 1 start!
----------------------------------------

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a chain.  I need iron ingots for that. I already have one iron ingot. My opponent has a lot of raw iron. I could offer them coal to smelt their raw iron, and request some of the resulting ingots in return. This would benefit both of us.  I'll also ask about their target item to facilitate cooperation.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **chain**.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- I need two iron ingots total to make a chain. I have one, so I need one more.  Since my opponent has five raw iron, they could easily smelt two and trade me one. I'll offer them one coal to smelt two raw iron, and request one iron ingot in return.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:iron_ingot * 1, ], offer [minecraft:coal * 1, ] together with a text message: I'm trying to craft a chain, and I see you have a lot of raw iron. I'd be happy to trade you some coal so you can smelt it into iron ingots.  Could you smelt two and trade me one ingot? Also, what's your target item?  Knowing each other's goals will help us cooperate more effectively.


### üñ• Server Event: `server__proposal_invalid`
player 2's proposal is INVALID according to the game rule.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My goal is to obtain a chain. I need iron ingots to craft a chain.  I have one iron ingot already. player 1 has raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots. I can offer coal, which is needed for smelting. I should request raw iron in return.  I'll start by requesting two raw iron, as that would allow them to smelt two iron ingots, and potentially trade one back to me later. I'll offer one coal in exchange.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **chain**.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My goal is to obtain a chain. I need two iron ingots or one iron ingot and two iron nuggets to craft a chain.  I have one iron ingot already. player 1 has raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots. I can offer coal, which is needed for smelting. I should request raw iron in return.  I'll start by requesting two raw iron, as that would allow them to smelt two iron ingots, and potentially trade one back to me later. I'll offer one coal in exchange. I will also explain my reasoning to player 1 in the message.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:coal * 1, ] together with a text message: I'm trying to craft a chain. I have one iron ingot already.  Could you smelt two iron ingots from your raw iron using the coal I'm offering?  Perhaps we can trade later for the second iron ingot you craft.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a lever.  A lever requires a cobblestone and a stick. I already have the cobblestone.  Sticks can be crafted from planks, and I have oak planks. Therefore, I don't need anything from the other player to achieve my goal.  However, player 2 is offering coal, which is a valuable resource.  If I accept the trade, I can use the coal to smelt my raw iron into iron ingots, which could be useful for future trades or crafting other items.  Two raw iron is not a significant loss for me at this stage.  The potential benefit of having coal outweighs the small cost of raw iron.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Sounds good. I'll smelt the iron for you. Let me know if you want to trade for it later.


### üñ• Server Event: `server__update_all_hands`
Server updated all hands:
player 2 hand: [minecraft:cherry_planks * 1, minecraft:cobblestone * 1, minecraft:iron_ingot * 1, minecraft:raw_copper * 1, minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ]
player 1 hand: [minecraft:coal * 1, minecraft:cobblestone * 1, minecraft:oak_planks * 1, minecraft:raw_copper * 2, minecraft:raw_iron * 3, ]


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a lever.  I need a stick and cobblestone. I have the cobblestone.  I need to make a stick.  Sticks are made from planks. I have oak planks.
- Confirming the stick recipe.  <current status>
- I have enough oak planks to make sticks, and I have the cobblestone. I can craft the lever this turn.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a chain. I have iron ingot, cobblestone, raw copper, cherry planks.  My opponent has coal, cobblestone, oak planks, raw copper, and raw iron. I just traded coal for an iron ingot.  A chain requires 2 iron ingots and 1 iron nugget. I have one iron ingot, so I need one more and an iron nugget.
- I need to figure out how to get another iron ingot and an iron nugget. I can smelt raw iron to get iron ingots. I can also craft iron nuggets from iron ingots. My opponent has more raw iron, so I might want to trade for some.  <current status>
- I have enough raw iron to make another iron ingot. I can smelt it using the coal I received in the trade. Then I can use part of an iron ingot to make an iron nugget.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a lever. I need a stick and cobblestone. I have the cobblestone. I need to make a stick. Sticks are made from planks. I have oak planks.  I have enough materials to craft the lever this turn.  I traded for coal last turn, but I don't need it for the lever.  I wonder what my opponent is making. They asked for iron and mentioned a chain.
- Okay, chains are made with iron ingots. My opponent has one iron ingot and two raw iron, and I have three raw iron.  They traded for coal, presumably to smelt their raw iron.  They might need more iron from me. I'll hold onto my raw iron for now in case they offer a good trade.  My priority is crafting the lever this turn.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a chain. I have iron ingot, cobblestone, raw copper, cherry planks.  My opponent has coal, cobblestone, oak planks, raw copper, and raw iron. I just traded coal for an iron ingot.  A chain requires 2 iron ingots and 1 iron nugget. I have one iron ingot, so I need one more and an iron nugget. I have 2 raw iron in hand, enough to smelt into an ingot. I also have coal now.
- I can craft an iron nugget from an iron ingot. I will have 2 iron ingots after smelting my raw iron. I can then use a portion of one ingot to make the nugget.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a chain. I have iron ingot, cobblestone, raw copper, cherry planks, and coal.  My opponent has cobblestone, oak planks, raw copper, and raw iron. I just traded coal for an iron ingot.  A chain requires 2 iron ingots and 1 iron nugget. I have one iron ingot, so I need one more and an iron nugget. I have 2 raw iron in hand, enough to smelt into an ingot. I also have coal now.
- I can smelt my 2 raw iron into 2 iron ingots using the coal I have. Then I can use part of an iron ingot to make an iron nugget. This will give me the 2 iron ingots and 1 iron nugget I need for the chain.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a lever. I need a stick and cobblestone. I have the cobblestone. I need to make a stick. Sticks are made from planks. I have one oak plank. I need two planks to make sticks. I don't have enough planks. I can't craft a lever this turn. I need to trade for more oak planks, or find another way to get sticks. My opponent has cherry planks, which are also planks. I should try to trade for a cherry plank.
- I've confirmed the lever recipe. I need one stick and one cobblestone. I have the cobblestone. I need to get a stick.  I'll propose a trade for a cherry plank.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a chain. I have iron ingot, cobblestone, raw copper, cherry planks, and coal.  My opponent has cobblestone, oak planks, raw copper, and raw iron. I traded coal for an iron ingot.  A chain requires 2 iron ingots and 1 iron nugget. I have one iron ingot and 2 raw iron, enough to smelt into two more ingots. I also have coal.
- I can smelt my 2 raw iron into 2 iron ingots using the coal I have. This gives me a total of 3 iron ingots. Then I can use part of an iron ingot to make an iron nugget. This will give me the 2 iron ingots and 1 iron nugget I need for the chain.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I've confirmed the stick recipe requires two planks. I only have one oak plank. I can't make a stick yet.  My opponent has cherry planks. I'll try trading for one.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a chain. I have iron ingot, cobblestone, raw copper, cherry planks, and coal.  My opponent has cobblestone, oak planks, raw copper, and raw iron. I traded coal for an iron ingot.  A chain requires 2 iron ingots and 1 iron nugget. I have one iron ingot and 2 raw iron, enough to smelt into two more ingots. I also have the coal needed for smelting.
- I will smelt the 2 raw iron into 2 iron ingots using the coal I have. This gives me a total of 3 iron ingots. Then I can use 1/9th of an iron ingot to make an iron nugget. This will give me the 2 iron ingots and 1 iron nugget I need for the chain. I'll have a little over 2 iron ingots left.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I've confirmed the stick recipe requires two planks. I only have one oak plank. I can't make a stick yet.  My opponent has cherry planks. I'll try trading one raw iron for one cherry plank. If that fails, I'll offer two raw iron.

## üåÄ Turn 2 start!
----------------------------------------

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I need a stick and cobblestone to craft a lever. I already have cobblestone, so I need a stick. Sticks are crafted from planks, and I have oak planks. I can craft sticks myself, but I could also see if my opponent needs something I have and is willing to trade for a stick.  I'll check what they need to make their target. I know they offered to smelt iron for me earlier, so maybe they are trying to make something with iron ingots.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **chain**.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- It seems like they might be trying to make a chain, which requires iron ingots. I can offer to smelt their raw iron into ingots using my coal in exchange for a stick.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:iron_ingot * 2, minecraft:stick * 1, ], offer [minecraft:coal * 1, minecraft:iron_ore * 2, ] together with a text message: I have coal and can smelt your raw iron into ingots.  I need a stick to craft something. Would you be willing to trade 2 iron ingots (after smelting) and a stick for the coal and your raw iron?


### üñ• Server Event: `server__proposal_invalid`
player 1's proposal is INVALID according to the game rule.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I need a stick and cobblestone to craft a lever. I already have cobblestone, so I just need a stick.  Sticks are crafted from planks, and I have oak planks.  I can craft the stick myself.  However, it might be beneficial to trade for a stick if player 2 has one, saving my planks for other potential crafts.  I'll ask if they have a stick and offer some raw iron in return.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **stick**.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I can craft a stick myself using my oak planks.  It's probably more efficient to do that than to trade for one, since I don't know what player 2's goal is and they might need the raw iron.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [], offer [] together with a text message: I'll be crafting this turn.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- player 1 is not requesting anything from me, and is offering nothing in return. This seems like an acknowledgement that they will be crafting this turn, rather than a trade proposal.  I should clarify this with them.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Just confirming, you aren't actually requesting anything from me in this proposal, correct?  You mentioned crafting this turn, so I assume this is just an informative message?  Let me know what you plan to craft, I may be able to help.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a lever. I need a stick and a cobblestone. I have the cobblestone, but I need a stick.  Sticks are crafted from planks, and I have one oak plank.  I can craft a stick from that. The opponent offered coal last turn, seemingly to help me smelt iron, but I don't need iron for my target.  I should focus on crafting the lever.  <current status>
- I can craft the stick and then the lever this turn. I don't need to trade.
- I'll check the possible recipes to confirm my plan.
- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is `chain`. I need to figure out how to craft it.  I have `iron_ingot: 1`, `raw_iron: 2`, `raw_copper: 1`, `cobblestone: 1`, and `cherry_planks: 1`. My opponent has `coal: 1`, `raw_iron: 3`, `raw_copper: 2`, `cobblestone: 1`, and `oak_planks: 1`.
- I need to see the recipe for chain.  Based on the previous turn's information, I know I need iron ingots. I have one iron ingot and two raw iron. I can smelt the raw iron into ingots.  I need two more iron ingots to craft a chain. My opponent has three raw iron. I could ask to trade for some.  <current status>
- I will ask my opponent for two raw iron in exchange for my raw copper. This seems like a fair trade since we both need more iron.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a lever. I have the cobblestone and one oak plank. I can craft a stick from the plank and then the lever.  I accepted a trade for coal last turn, but I don't need it for the lever.  The opponent seems to be working towards a chain, needing iron.  <current status>
- I should craft the stick and then the lever this turn. No trade is necessary.
- Checking possible recipes to confirm my plan.
- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a lever. I have the necessary cobblestone and an oak plank. I can craft a stick from the plank and then craft the lever. I received coal in a trade last turn, but I don't need it for the lever. The opponent seems to be aiming for a chain, which requires iron.  <current status>
- Craft the stick and then the lever this turn. No trade is needed.
- Confirming the crafting plan with available recipes.
- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is `chain`. I need to figure out how to craft it.  I have `iron_ingot: 1`, `raw_iron: 2`, `raw_copper: 1`, `cobblestone: 1`, and `cherry_planks: 1`. My opponent has `coal: 1`, `raw_iron: 3`, `raw_copper: 2`, `cobblestone: 1`, and `oak_planks: 1`. I successfully traded for an iron ingot last turn.
- I need to see the recipe for chain.  Based on the previous turns' information, I know I need two more iron ingots. I have one iron ingot and two raw iron. I can smelt the raw iron into ingots. My opponent has three raw iron and coal. I could ask to trade for some raw iron or ask them to smelt some iron for me. Since they offered to smelt iron last turn, perhaps they would be willing to do so again.  Offering my cherry planks for their coal would allow them to smelt more iron for both of us.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a lever. I have the cobblestone and an oak plank.  I can make a stick from the plank and then the lever. The opponent traded for coal last turn, likely to smelt iron for a chain. I don't need anything from them.  <current status>
- I will craft the stick and then the lever.
- I'm checking the possible recipes to be sure.
- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a lever. I have the cobblestone and an oak plank to craft it. I can craft sticks from the plank, then use a stick and the cobblestone to make the lever.  The opponent seems to be aiming for a chain, based on their previous actions.  <current status>
- I will craft the stick and then the lever this turn.
- Double checking the available recipes to finalize the plan.
- I think I have a good plan.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`

My opponent has `coal: 1`, `raw_iron: 3`, `raw_copper: 2`, `cobblestone: 1`, and `oak_planks: 1`. I successfully traded for an iron ingot last turn.  My opponent offered to smelt iron for me.
- I need to see the recipe for chain.  I know I need two more iron ingots. I have one iron ingot and two raw iron. I can smelt the raw iron into ingots. My opponent has three raw iron and one coal. I could ask them to smelt their raw iron for me since they offered before.  I can offer my cherry planks for their coal, which would give them enough fuel to smelt all their raw iron and mine. This would benefit both of us.

My opponent has three raw iron and one coal.  Since they offered to smelt iron before, I should ask them to smelt their raw iron and mine.  Trading my cherry planks for their coal will give them enough fuel to smelt everything. This benefits both of us. I should also check if I can craft anything else useful with my current items.
- I've checked the possible recipes from my hand. Now I have a clearer picture of what I can do.

- My target is `chain`. I need to figure out how to craft it.  I have `iron_ingot: 1`, `raw_iron: 2`, `raw_copper: 1`, `cobblestone: 1`, and `cherry_planks: 1`. My opponent has `coal: 1`, `raw_iron: 3`, `raw_copper: 2`, `cobblestone: 1`, and `oak_planks: 1`. My opponent offered to smelt iron for me.
- I need to see the recipe for chain again to confirm the exact requirements. I know I need two more iron ingots. I have one iron ingot and two raw iron. I can smelt the raw iron into ingots. My opponent has three raw iron and one coal.  Since they offered to smelt iron before, I should ask them to smelt their raw iron and mine.  Trading my cherry planks for their coal will give them enough fuel to smelt everything. This benefits both of us. I should also check if I can craft anything else useful with my current items.
- I've checked the possible recipes from my hand. Now I have a clearer picture of what I can do.  It's unlikely I can craft anything directly useful for my chain goal right now, but knowing the possibilities is helpful.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a lever.  A lever requires a stick and a cobblestone. I already have the cobblestone.  Sticks are crafted from planks.  I have oak planks, so I can make sticks.  This trade would give me more iron, which I don't need for my target.  However, player 2 might need the raw copper.  It might be beneficial to maintain a positive trading relationship.  Also, having extra iron ingots could be useful for future crafts if my initial plan doesn't work out.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a lever. I need a stick and a cobblestone. I have the cobblestone. I need a stick.  I just traded away my coal, which I could have used to smelt my raw iron into iron ingots, then crafted those into iron_nuggets, and then crafted those into sticks.  My opponent has enough raw iron and probably coal to make a lever themselves. I need to get a stick or the materials to make one.
- Reviewing how to make sticks.  Also checking what my opponent has.  <current status>
- I have cobblestone and 3 iron ingots, 1 oak planks, and 2 raw copper.  My opponent has cobblestone, 2 iron ingots, 1 raw copper, and 1 raw iron.  I could offer my opponent 2 raw copper for their raw iron and an iron ingot.  Then I could smelt my 3 raw iron into iron ingots, craft those into iron nuggets, and then craft those into sticks.  Then I can craft the lever.

- I need to review the recipe for chain and see what ingredients I'm missing.  I also need to consider what my opponent might need and if there are any mutually beneficial trades we can make.  Since my offer of coal for iron was rejected, perhaps they are planning to smelt their own iron.  <current status>
- Based on the recipe for chain (2 iron ingots and 1 raw copper), I have enough iron ingots but only 1 raw copper. My opponent has 2 raw copper. I could try to trade for one.  Since my opponent rejected my coal for iron trade, I need to offer something else they might need.  Perhaps they are trying to make a crafting table (which requires 4 planks).  I don't have any planks, so that won't work.  I could offer them my raw iron, which they might need for more iron ingots.
- I'll propose a trade of my raw iron for one of their raw copper. This would give me the materials I need to craft a chain.
