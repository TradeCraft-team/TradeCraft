## 🌀 Turn 1 start!
----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `player 2 ` THINKS:
- I need to craft a bucket, which requires iron ingots. Let me check the recipe for a bucket first to understand what I need.
- I see that to craft a bucket, I need 3 iron ingots. Currently, I have only 1 iron ingot in my hand, but I need 3 total. My opponent has 5 raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots.  Let me check how to convert raw iron to iron ingots.

### 🧠 `player 2 ` THINKS:
- I need to craft a bucket, which requires 3 iron ingots. Currently, I have only 1 iron ingot in my hand. My opponent has 5 raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots. I also have 1 coal which can be used for smelting.  My strategy should be to trade for some of my opponent's raw iron. I need at least 2 more iron ingots, so I need at least 2 raw iron. I could offer something valuable to my opponent in exchange.  Let me check what I can offer that might be valuable to them.
- I see that raw copper can be smelted into copper ingots. My opponent already has 2 raw copper, and I have 1. I could offer my raw copper to them, which might help them craft something they need.  I also have cherry planks, coal, cobblestone, and an iron ingot. Let me consider what would be a fair trade.  Since I need 2 more raw iron to craft a bucket (along with my existing iron ingot), I should request 2 raw iron from my opponent. In exchange, I could offer my raw copper and perhaps my cherry planks or cobblestone.  I think a fair proposal would be: - Offer: 1 raw copper and 1 cherry planks - Request: 2 raw iron  This way, my opponent still has 3 raw iron left, and they gain additional resources. I'll craft this into a proposal with a persuasive message.

I could offer something valuable to my opponent in exchange.  Looking at what I have to offer: cherry planks, coal, cobblestone, iron ingot, and raw copper. My opponent already has cobblestone and raw copper, so those might be less valuable to them. The cherry planks could be useful for building, and coal is valuable for smelting.  Since I need 2 more raw iron to craft a bucket (along with my existing iron ingot), I should request 2 raw iron from my opponent.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2  submit a proposal to Player 1 , request [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:cherry_planks * 1, minecraft:raw_copper * 1, ] together with a text message: I'm offering you my raw copper to add to your collection, plus some cherry planks which are useful for building. In exchange, I need just 2 of your raw iron. This is a balanced trade that leaves you with plenty of raw iron (3) while giving you more diversity in your resources. This trade benefits both of us for our crafting goals!

### 🧠 `Player 1 ` THINKS:
- ** My target is to craft a lever. To craft a lever in Minecraft, I need 1 cobblestone and 1 stick. I currently have 1 cobblestone and 1 oak plank, which can be used to craft sticks. I need to check if I can craft sticks from my oak plank and then craft the lever.

- While waiting for the bucket recipe information, let me check what recipes I can currently craft with the items in my hand.
- Let me also check information about iron ingots since I have one in my hand and it's likely needed for the bucket.
- I should also check what I can do with raw iron, since my opponent has 5 of them.
- I think I have enough information now to make a plan. Let me analyze what I've learned and create a strategy.

In exchange, I need cherry planks to craft sticks for my lever. This trade helps both of us progress towards our crafting goals!


### 🖥 Server Event: `server__proposal_invalid`
Player 1 's proposal is INVALID according to the game rule.


### 🧠 `Player 1 ` THINKS:
- I need to craft a lever, which requires cobblestone and a stick. I currently have cobblestone, but I need a stick. To craft a stick, I need wooden planks. Player 2  has cherry planks, which can be used to craft sticks. I should propose a trade that helps me obtain cherry planks.

I'm offering raw copper in exchange, which can be smelted into copper ingots for your crafting needs. Let's help each other achieve our goals!


### 🧠 `player 2 ` THINKS:
- I need to evaluate this trade proposal carefully. My team's target is to craft 1 bucket. Let me first check what's needed to craft a bucket.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2  checked the item info of craft: **bucket**.


### 🧠 `player 2 ` THINKS:
- I see that to craft a bucket, I need 3 iron ingots. Currently, I only have 1 iron ingot, so I need 2 more. Let me check what I can do with raw copper, which is what Player 1  is offering me.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2  checked the item info of craft: **raw_copper**.


### 🧠 `player 2 ` THINKS:
- I see that raw copper can be smelted into copper ingots using fuel. However, this doesn't directly help me with my goal of crafting a bucket, which requires 3 iron ingots. Let me check what I can do with cherry planks, which Player 1  wants from me.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2  checked the item info of craft: **cherry_planks**.


### 🧠 `player 2 ` THINKS:
- I need to carefully evaluate this trade. My goal is to craft a bucket, which requires 3 iron ingots. Currently I have: - 1 iron ingot (need 2 more) - 1 cherry planks - 1 copper ingot - 1 stone  Player 1  wants my cherry planks and is offering raw copper. Let me check what I can do with raw iron, since that's what I need more of.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2  checked the item info of craft: **raw_iron**.


### 🧠 `player 2 ` THINKS:
- I see that raw iron can be smelted into iron ingots using fuel. Player 1  has 5 raw iron, which would be much more valuable to me than raw copper since I need iron ingots to craft my bucket.  Looking at the fuel options, I notice that cherry planks can be used as fuel (2/3 fuel value). This means my cherry planks could potentially be useful for smelting raw iron into iron ingots. If I trade away my cherry planks for raw copper, I'm losing a potential fuel source that could help me craft my target item.  Additionally, I already have a copper ingot, so getting more raw copper isn't as valuable to me as keeping my cherry planks for fuel. I should focus on acquiring more raw iron or iron ingots directly.  The trade doesn't align with my goal of crafting a bucket. I should reject this proposal and perhaps suggest a trade involving raw iron instead.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2  decided to reject the proposal with a text message: Thank you for your offer, but I need to keep my cherry planks as they can be used as fuel for smelting. I'm actually more interested in raw iron since my goal requires iron ingots. Would you be willing to trade some of your raw iron instead?

- My team's target is to craft a bucket. Let me first check the recipe for a bucket to understand what ingredients I need.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2  checked the item info of craft: **bucket**.


### 🧠 `player 2 ` THINKS:
- I see that to craft a bucket, I need 3 iron ingots. Currently, I have only 1 iron ingot, so I need 2 more. Looking at Player 1 's inventory, they have 5 raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots. This is exactly what I need!  Let me check the recipe for turning raw iron into iron ingots to confirm.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2  checked the item info of craft: **iron_ingot**.


### 🧠 `player 2 ` THINKS:
- I need to craft a bucket which requires 3 iron ingots. I currently have 1 iron ingot, so I need 2 more. Player 1  has 5 raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots. I should propose a trade to get some of their raw iron.  Looking at what I have to offer: - cherry_planks (1) - copper_ingot (1) - iron_ingot (1) - stone (1)  And what Player 1  has: - cobblestone_slab (2) - oak_button (1) - raw_copper (2) - raw_iron (5)  I see that Player 1  previously tried to get my cherry_planks, offering raw copper in exchange. This suggests they need the planks. I could offer my cherry_planks, but I should ask for raw iron instead of giving up my only iron ingot.  I'll propose trading my cherry_planks for 2 raw iron. This seems fair as they previously showed interest in my planks, and I need the raw iron to craft my bucket.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2  submit a proposal to Player 1 , request [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:cherry_planks * 1, ] together with a text message: I noticed you were interested in my cherry planks earlier. I'm willing to trade them for 2 raw iron, which would help me with my crafting goals. This trade would benefit both of us - you get the planks you need, and I get materials I need for my target item.

I need to figure out how to obtain a stick. I have the following items in my hand: cobblestone_slab, oak_button, raw_copper, and raw_iron. My opponent, Player 2 , has cherry_planks, copper_ingot, iron_ingot, and stone. Cherry planks can be used to craft sticks, so I need to trade for cherry planks or find another way to get sticks.
- ** I need to understand how to craft a stick and what materials are required. This will help me determine if I can craft it with my current resources or if I need to trade for additional items.
- ** I have learned that sticks can be crafted from planks. Since Player 2  has cherry_planks, I should consider trading for them. However, Player 2  has already rejected my previous offer for cherry_planks, and he seems interested in my raw_iron. I need to decide if trading raw_iron for cherry_planks is worth it.
- ** I should also consider what Player 2 's target might be. He mentioned needing iron ingots, which suggests his target might require iron. If I trade raw_iron, I might be helping him get closer to his target. I need to weigh the benefits of getting cherry_planks against the risk of helping Player 2 .
- ** To avoid helping Player 2  too much, I should try to negotiate a trade that benefits me more. I could offer a smaller amount of raw_iron or try to include other items in the trade to make it more balanced.
- ** I think I have a good plan.

### 🧠 `player 2 ` THINKS:
- To craft a bucket, I need 3 iron ingots. Currently, I have: - 1 iron ingot - 2 raw iron  I can smelt the raw iron into iron ingots, but I would need fuel. Looking at my opponent's inventory, they have: - 2 cobblestone slabs - 1 oak button (which can be used as fuel) - 2 raw copper - 3 raw iron - 1 smooth stone  I need 1 more iron ingot to reach my goal of 3 iron ingots for a bucket. I could either: 1. Request more raw iron to smelt 2. Request an iron ingot directly  Since my opponent has 3 raw iron, I could propose trading my copper ingot for some of their raw iron. This would be beneficial for both of us - they get a processed copper ingot (saving them fuel and time), and I get more raw iron to smelt into iron ingots for my bucket.

This trade benefits both of us - you get more raw iron for your crafting needs, and I get an iron ingot that might help me with my crafting goals. Let's work together to achieve our targets!


### 🧠 `player 2 ` THINKS:

### 🧠 `player 2 ` THINKS:
- I see that to craft a bucket, I need 3 iron ingots. Currently, I have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron. If I accept this trade, I'll have 0 iron ingots and 4 raw iron. Let me check what I can do with raw iron.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2  checked the item info of craft: **raw_iron**.


### 🧠 `player 2 ` THINKS:
- I see that to craft a bucket, I need 3 iron ingots. Currently, I have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron. If I accept this trade, I'll have 0 iron ingots and 4 raw iron.  Looking at the recipe for raw iron, I can see that I can smelt raw iron into iron ingots using fuel. The ratio is 1 raw iron + fuel = 1 iron ingot.  If I accept this trade, I'll have 4 raw iron, which I can smelt into 4 iron ingots (assuming I have or can get fuel). This would give me more than the 3 iron ingots I need for a bucket.  If I reject this trade, I'll keep my 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron, which would only give me 3 iron ingots total after smelting the raw iron.  So accepting this trade would actually give me more potential iron ingots in the end (4 instead of 3), which is beneficial for crafting my bucket target. I just need to make sure I have fuel for smelting.  Let me check if I have any items that can be used as fuel.

- I need to evaluate this trade proposal carefully. My team's target is to craft a bucket, which requires 3 iron ingots.  Currently, I have: - 1 iron ingot - 2 raw iron - 1 copper ingot  If I accept this trade, I'll have: - 0 iron ingots - 4 raw iron - 1 copper ingot  To craft a bucket, I need 3 iron ingots. I can smelt raw iron into iron ingots with fuel. Looking at the fuel options, I don't currently have any obvious fuel items in my inventory.  If I keep my current 1 iron ingot and smelt my 2 raw iron, I would have 3 iron ingots total - exactly what I need for a bucket.  If I trade away my 1 iron ingot for 2 more raw iron, I'd have 4 raw iron, which could potentially give me 4 iron ingots after smelting - but only if I can find fuel.  Since I don't see any fuel in my current inventory, trading away my already-processed iron ingot seems risky. I'd be giving up a guaranteed component of my target item for raw materials that still need processing with resources I don't currently have.  The safer approach is to keep my iron ingot and focus on smelting the raw iron I already have to reach my target of 3 iron ingots.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`

- I need to craft a bucket, which requires 3 iron ingots. Currently, I have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron. I need one more iron ingot to reach my goal. I can smelt my raw iron into iron ingots, but I need fuel for that. Looking at Player 1 's inventory, they have an oak_button which can be used as fuel (as seen in the item_info), and they also have additional raw_iron which could be useful for me.  Since I need both fuel and potentially more raw iron, I should propose a trade where I offer something valuable to Player 1  in exchange. I have a copper_ingot that I could offer, which might be useful for their crafting goals.  I'll propose trading my copper_ingot for their oak_button and some raw_iron. This would give me the fuel I need to smelt my existing raw iron, plus additional raw iron to potentially craft more iron ingots.

I'm offering my copper_ingot in exchange for your oak_button and 1 raw_iron.

This trade would actually set me back in my progress toward crafting a bucket. Right now, I have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron, which means I could potentially have 3 iron ingots (exactly what I need for a bucket) if I can find fuel to smelt the raw iron.  If I accept this trade, I'll have 0 iron ingots and 4 raw iron, which means I'd need to smelt all 4 raw iron to get the 3 iron ingots I need, requiring more fuel.  Additionally, it seems like Player 1  might be trying to collect iron ingots, possibly for their own crafting goals.

- I need to craft a bucket, which typically requires 3 iron ingots in Minecraft. Currently, I have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron. I need to either get more iron ingots directly or get more raw iron that I can smelt into ingots. Let me check the recipe for a bucket to confirm.

Looking at my opponent's inventory, they have 3 raw iron, which would be valuable for me. They also have an oak_button which could potentially be used as fuel for smelting.  From Player 1 's previous message, they mentioned their target is a lever. Let me check what's needed to craft a lever.

- I need to craft a bucket, which requires 3 iron ingots. Currently, I have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron. I need more iron to reach my goal.  Looking at Player 1 's inventory, they have 3 raw iron which would be valuable for me. They also mentioned their target is a lever, which requires cobblestone and a stick. They already have cobblestone slabs, but might need other materials.  I notice they have an oak_button which could be useful as fuel for smelting. Since they're trying to craft a lever, they might be willing to trade some of their raw iron for something that helps them toward their goal.  I could offer my copper_ingot, which isn't directly useful for my bucket goal. Let me propose trading my copper_ingot for some of their raw_iron.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2  submit a proposal to Player 1 , request [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:copper_ingot * 1, ] together with a text message: I noticed you're trying to craft a lever. While I need iron for my crafting goals, I can offer you my copper ingot which might be useful for your future crafting needs. In exchange, I'm requesting 2 raw iron, which would help me progress toward my goal. This trade would still leave you with 1 raw iron plus the new copper ingot, giving you more diverse crafting options.


### 🧠 `Player 1 ` THINKS:
- I need to evaluate whether this trade helps me move closer to crafting my target item, which is a lever. A lever in Minecraft is crafted using cobblestone and a stick. I currently have cobblestone slabs, which can be converted to cobblestone, and I need a stick. I should check if the copper ingot is useful for crafting a stick or if it helps in any other way towards crafting a lever.

Player 1  checked the item info of craft: **lever**.


### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`

- Now I see that Player 1  needs cobblestone and a stick to craft a lever. They already have cobblestone slabs, which are made from cobblestone. They also have an oak button, which is made from oak planks, and oak planks can be used to craft sticks.  Since Player 1  has rejected my previous offers to trade my copper ingot or iron ingot, I need to try a different approach. I notice they have 1 raw iron, which could be useful for me. I could offer some of my raw iron in exchange for their smooth stone, which might be valuable for other crafting recipes.  Let me make a proposal that might be more appealing to Player 1 :

Looking at Player 1 's inventory: - 2 cobblestone slabs - 1 copper ingot - 1 oak button - 2 raw copper - 1 raw iron - 1 smooth stone  From previous interactions, I've learned that Player 1  is trying to craft a lever, which requires cobblestone and a stick. They already have cobblestone slabs and an oak button (which is made from oak planks, which can be used to craft sticks).  Since my previous offers of copper ingot and iron ingot were rejected, I need a new approach. I notice they have 1 raw iron which could be useful to me, and they have 1 smooth stone which they acquired in a previous trade.  Let me propose a trade that might be mutually beneficial.
- My proposal looks good now. I'll offer some of my raw iron in exchange for their raw iron and smooth stone. This could be beneficial for both of us as I'm working toward crafting a bucket.

- My team's target is to craft a bucket, which requires 3 iron ingots. Currently, I have: - 1 iron ingot - 4 raw iron  I need 2 more iron ingots to reach my goal. To convert raw iron to iron ingots, I need coal for smelting, which I don't have.  Looking at Player 1 's inventory: - 2 cobblestone slabs - 1 copper ingot - 1 oak button - 2 raw copper - 1 raw iron - 1 smooth stone  From previous interactions, I know Player 1  is trying to craft a lever. They've rejected my previous offers of copper ingot and iron ingot, so I need a different approach.  I could try to trade for their smooth stone, which might be useful for other crafting recipes. I'll offer some of my raw iron in exchange.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2  submit a proposal to Player 1 , request [minecraft:smooth_stone * 1, ], offer [minecraft:raw_iron * 1, ] together with a text message: I notice you have smooth stone which could be useful for various crafting recipes. I'm offering raw iron which you might need for future crafting. This trade would help both of us diversify our materials. I've noticed you're working toward crafting a lever - while this trade doesn't directly help with that, having diverse materials is always beneficial in Minecraft.


### 🧠 `Player 1 ` THINKS:
- I need to evaluate whether this trade will help me get closer to crafting a lever, which is my target item. I should check the crafting recipe for a lever to see if raw iron or smooth stone is more beneficial for my crafting goals.

### 🧠 `player 2 ` THINKS:
- I see that a bucket requires 3 iron ingots to craft. Currently, I have 1 iron ingot and 3 raw iron. I need to consider whether trading away my only iron ingot for a copper ingot would help me reach my goal.  Let me check what I can do with raw iron.

### 🧠 `player 2 ` THINKS:
- I need to evaluate whether trading my iron_ingot for a copper_ingot helps me reach my target of crafting a bucket.  From the item_info, I can see that a bucket requires 3 iron_ingots to craft. Currently, I have: - 1 iron_ingot - 3 raw_iron - 2 smooth_stone_slabs  To craft a bucket, I need 3 iron_ingots total. I already have 1, and I can smelt my 3 raw_iron into 3 more iron_ingots (with fuel). That would give me 4 iron_ingots total, which is enough to craft a bucket.  If I trade away my only iron_ingot for a copper_ingot, I would only have 3 raw_iron left. Even after smelting those, I'd only have 3 iron_ingots, which is just enough for a bucket, but with no margin for error. Additionally, copper_ingot doesn't help me craft a bucket at all.  This trade would: 1. Reduce my iron resources 2. Give me a copper_ingot that doesn't contribute to my bucket goal 3. Make my path to crafting a bucket more difficult  Player 1  is likely trying to get iron for their own crafting needs, but this trade doesn't benefit my goal.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
