## 🌀 Turn 1 start!
----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `Player 1 ` THINKS:
- To craft shears, I need to know the recipe. Typically, shears in Minecraft are crafted using iron ingots. I currently have 1 iron ingot, and my opponent has 5 raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots. I should confirm the recipe for shears to ensure I have the correct materials.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
Player 1  submit a proposal to player 2 , request [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:coal * 1, minecraft:cobblestone * 1, ] together with a text message: Hi Player 2 , I'm offering you coal, which can be used as fuel, and cobblestone, a versatile crafting material. In exchange, I would like 2 raw iron. This trade will benefit both of us by enhancing our crafting capabilities. Let's work together to achieve our goals!


### 🧠 `player 2 ` THINKS:
- I need to evaluate this trade based on my goal of crafting a torch. Let me first understand what's needed to craft a torch.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2  checked the item info of craft: **torch**.


### 🧠 `player 2 ` THINKS:
- I see that to craft a torch, I need: 1. 1 stick 2. 1 coal (from the #coals category)  And this recipe produces 4 torches. So I definitely need coal to craft my target item. Let me check what I need to craft a stick.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2  checked the item info of craft: **stick**.


### 🧠 `player 2 ` THINKS:
- Now I understand what I need to craft a torch:  1. Coal (1 unit) 2. Stick (1 unit)  To make a stick, I need 2 planks (which produces 4 sticks). I already have oak_planks in my inventory, so I can craft sticks.  Looking at the trade offer: - I give: 2 raw_iron - I receive: 1 coal and 1 cobblestone  This is a very good trade for me because: 1. Coal is essential for crafting torches (my target item) 2. I already have oak_planks to craft sticks 3. I have 5 raw_iron, so giving 2 won't deplete my resources too much 4. The extra cobblestone could be useful for other crafting, though not directly needed for torches  Since my goal is to craft a torch, and coal is a required ingredient that I don't currently have, this trade directly helps me achieve my goal. The opponent is asking for raw_iron which I have plenty of (5 units).

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2  decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Thank you for the offer! This trade works perfectly for me. The coal will be very useful, and I'm happy to provide the raw iron in exchange.
