## üåÄ Turn 1 start!
----------------------------------------

### üß† `player 2 ` THINKS:
- I need to craft shears, which requires iron ingots. Let me first check the recipe for shears to understand what I need.
- I see that shears require 2 iron ingots to craft. Currently, I have: - 1 iron ingot - 1 raw copper - 1 coal - 1 cherry planks - 1 cobblestone  I need 1 more iron ingot to craft shears. My opponent has 5 raw iron but no iron ingots. Let me check how to convert raw iron to iron ingots.

- Perfect! I can see that to make an iron ingot, I need: - 1 raw iron - 1/8 coal  I already have 1 coal, which is enough to smelt 8 raw iron into 8 iron ingots. My opponent has 5 raw iron, and I need just 1 more raw iron to craft my target item (shears).  My proposal strategy: 1. I'll request 1 raw iron from my opponent 2. I can offer my raw copper in exchange, which seems fair 3. This way, I'll have 1 iron ingot + 1 raw iron + coal, which is enough to craft another iron ingot and then craft shears  Let me make this proposal to Player 1 .

- My proposal looks good now. I'll offer 1 raw copper in exchange for 1 raw iron from Player 1 . This is a fair trade of raw materials, and it will allow me to craft the second iron ingot I need to make shears.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2  submit a proposal to <UNKNOWN>, request [minecraft:iron_ore * 1, ], offer [minecraft:coal * 1, ] together with a text message: I'd like to propose a trade, but I need more details about what items you're interested in and what you're offering.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2  checked the item info of craft: **shears**.


### üß† `player 2 ` THINKS:
- I see that to craft shears, I need 2 iron ingots. Looking at my current hand, I already have 1 iron ingot, so I need 1 more. My opponent has 5 raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots. Let me check the recipe for turning raw iron into iron ingots.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2  checked the item info of craft: **iron_ingot**.


### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2  submit a proposal to Player 1 , request [minecraft:raw_iron * 1, ], offer [minecraft:coal * 1, ] together with a text message: I'm offering coal which you can use as fuel for smelting. In exchange, I'd like one raw iron which I need for my crafting goals. This is a fair trade as coal is essential for smelting operations, and you have multiple raw iron. This trade would benefit both of us in our crafting journeys.


### üß† `Player 1 ` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a torch. To craft a torch in Minecraft, I need coal and a stick. I currently have 5 raw iron and no coal. The proposal offers me coal, which is essential for crafting a torch. I should verify the crafting recipe for a torch to ensure that this trade aligns with my winning strategy.
