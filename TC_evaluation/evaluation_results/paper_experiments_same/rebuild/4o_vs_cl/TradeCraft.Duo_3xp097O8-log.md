- I need to craft shears, which requires iron ingots. Let me first check the recipe for shears to understand what I need.
- I see that shears require 2 iron ingots to craft. Currently, I have: - 1 iron ingot - 1 raw copper - 1 coal - 1 cherry planks - 1 cobblestone  I need 1 more iron ingot to craft shears. My opponent has 5 raw iron but no iron ingots. Let me check how to convert raw iron to iron ingots.

- Perfect! I can see that to make an iron ingot, I need: - 1 raw iron - 1/8 coal  I already have 1 coal, which is enough to smelt 8 raw iron into 8 iron ingots. My opponent has 5 raw iron, and I need just 1 more raw iron to craft my target item (shears).  My proposal strategy: 1. I'll request 1 raw iron from my opponent 2. I can offer my raw copper in exchange, which seems fair 3. This way, I'll have 1 iron ingot + 1 raw iron + coal, which is enough to craft another iron ingot and then craft shears  Let me make this proposal to Player 1 .
