## 🌀 Turn 1 start!
----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I need 3 iron ingots to make a bucket. I have 1 iron ingot, and my opponent has 5 raw iron.  I can propose a trade for some raw iron. I can smelt raw iron into iron ingots using my coal as fuel.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **bucket**.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I will offer my raw copper since I don't need it for my target. I'll request 3 raw iron.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:raw_iron * 3, ], offer [minecraft:raw_copper * 1, ] together with a text message: I need 3 raw iron to make a bucket. I can offer you my raw copper in exchange.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a stone shovel.  I need cobblestone and sticks. I already have one cobblestone. Sticks are crafted from planks, and I have oak planks.  Trading away raw iron won't hurt my ability to craft a stone shovel. Getting more raw copper doesn't directly help me, but it could be useful for future trades.  Since I have plenty of raw iron, accepting the trade seems reasonable.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Sounds good. I have plenty of raw iron.
