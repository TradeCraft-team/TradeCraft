## 🌀 Turn 1 start!
----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I need 3 iron ingots to make a bucket. I have 1 iron ingot, and my opponent has 5 raw iron.  I can propose a trade for some raw iron. I can smelt raw iron into iron ingots using my coal as fuel.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **bucket**.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I will offer my raw copper since I don't need it for my target. I'll request 3 raw iron.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:raw_iron * 3, ], offer [minecraft:raw_copper * 1, ] together with a text message: I need 3 raw iron to make a bucket. I can offer you my raw copper in exchange.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a lever.  A lever requires a cobblestone and a stick. I already have cobblestone.  Sticks can be crafted from planks, and I have oak planks. Therefore, I don't need raw copper.  Trading away raw iron might be beneficial if I need it later for something else, but right now it doesn't hurt me to keep it.  Since I don't need the copper, I'm inclined to reject the trade.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **lever**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- Confirming that a lever needs cobblestone and a stick. I have both, so I don't need anything from the trade.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2 decided to reject the proposal with a text message: I don't need raw copper right now.

- I see that a lever can be crafted with a cobblestone and a stick. I have the cobblestone, but I need a stick.  Sticks are crafted from planks. I have oak planks.

- I think I have a good plan.

## 🌀 Turn 2 start!
----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I need a stick and cobblestone to craft a lever. I already have cobblestone.  I can craft sticks from planks. I have oak planks, so I can make sticks myself.  Let's see what player 1 has that I might want.  Maybe they have extra sticks or something else useful.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **lever**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I have enough materials to make a lever. I don't need to trade.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [], offer [] together with a text message: I don't need anything right now.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- player 2 is offering nothing and requesting nothing. This is effectively a null trade.  It doesn't hurt me to accept, but it also doesn't help me.  I need 3 iron ingots to make a bucket. I have one, and they have enough raw iron to make several more. I should try to trade for some.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **bucket**.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **iron_ingot**.


### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1 decided to reject the proposal with a text message: I need iron ingots.  Would you trade 2 raw iron for my copper ingot?


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a lever. I need a stick and a cobblestone. I have the cobblestone, but I need a stick.  Sticks are crafted from planks, and I have one oak plank.  My opponent has cherry planks and a cobblestone, as well as copper and iron ingots.  They seem to want iron.
- I've confirmed the lever recipe. Now I need to figure out how to get the proposal accepted.  My opponent rejected my last offer of a stick for their iron ingot. They seem to need iron. I could offer them some raw iron for their copper ingot, then use the copper ingot to sweeten a future trade for their cherry planks.  Or, I could just offer them enough raw iron for their cherry planks now.
- Offering two raw iron for the cherry planks might be a good starting point.  If they reject that, I can try offering more.  If they accept, I can craft the stick and then the lever.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket. I need 3 iron ingots to craft it. I currently have 1 iron ingot. My opponent has 5 raw iron, which can be smelted into 5 iron ingots. I need to trade for at least 2 iron ingots or 2 raw iron.  I can offer my copper ingot or cherry planks.
- Confirming the recipe for a bucket.  <current status>
- I will try to trade my copper ingot for 2 raw iron. If that fails, I will try trading my cherry planks for 2 raw iron.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a lever. I have the cobblestone, but I need a stick. Sticks are crafted from planks. I have one oak plank, enough to make 4 sticks. My opponent has cherry planks, which I could also use to make sticks. They seem to want iron, having rejected my previous offer of a stick for their iron ingot and requesting raw iron for their copper ingot.
- Confirmed the lever recipe.  I need to secure a plank to craft the stick.  Since I already have an oak plank, I don't necessarily need to trade.  However, trading might be beneficial in the long run if I need more planks later.  I'll try offering a smaller amount of raw iron for their cherry planks this time.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket. I need 3 iron ingots to craft it. I currently have 1 iron ingot. My opponent has 5 raw iron, which can be smelted into 5 iron ingots. I need to trade for at least 2 iron ingots or 2 raw iron.  I can offer my copper ingot or cherry planks. I also have cobblestone which I don't currently need.
- Confirming the recipe for a bucket and checking if there are any other uses for my current items.  <current status>
- I will try to trade my copper ingot and cobblestone for 2 raw iron. If that fails, I will try trading my cherry planks and cobblestone for 2 raw iron. If that also fails, I will try trading just my cherry planks for 1 raw iron and hope they accept a smaller trade.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a lever. I have the cobblestone and an oak plank. I can craft a stick from the plank and then the lever.  Trading isn't strictly necessary, but could be beneficial for future turns. My opponent seems to want iron.  I'll offer a small amount of raw iron for their cherry planks, but I'm prepared to craft the lever with my own resources if the trade fails.
- I think I have a good plan.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I have a good plan.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket. I need 3 iron ingots to craft it. I currently have 1 iron ingot. My opponent has 5 raw iron, which can be smelted into 5 iron ingots. I need to trade for at least 2 iron ingots or 2 raw iron.  I can offer my copper ingot or cherry planks. I also have cobblestone which I don't currently need.
- I will try to trade my copper ingot and cobblestone for 2 raw iron. If that fails, I will try trading my cherry planks and cobblestone for 2 raw iron. If that also fails, I will try trading just my cherry planks for 1 raw iron and hope they accept a smaller trade.  I will also check what can be crafted with raw iron, just in case my opponent is trying to craft something other than a bucket.
- Now I have a better understanding of what my opponent might be crafting.

- My target is a lever.  A lever requires a stick and cobblestone. I already have cobblestone.  Sticks can be crafted from planks, and I have oak planks.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket. I need 3 iron ingots to craft it. I currently have 2 iron ingots and 1 raw iron. Player 2 has 3 raw iron.  My previous attempts to trade for raw iron have failed. Offering cobblestone, cherry planks, and even both together didn't work.  Player 2 seems to be prioritizing raw iron, so offering my own iron ingot is too risky.  I need to consider alternative strategies.  Perhaps I should focus on acquiring fuel first, so I can smelt my existing raw iron. Then I can offer a crafted iron ingot for their raw iron, which might be more appealing.  I need to figure out how to get fuel though.
- Let's see what I can craft with what I have.  Maybe there's a way to make fuel.  <current status>
- Assuming I can't craft fuel directly, I need to re-evaluate my trading strategy.  My best bet is still to try and get raw iron from Player 2.  Since offering individual items and combinations haven't worked, I'll try offering everything I'm willing to part with – cobblestone and cherry planks – for *two* raw iron. This is a more significant offer and might be enough to tempt them.

- My target is a bucket, which requires 3 iron ingots. I have 2 iron ingots and 1 raw iron. Player 2 has 3 raw iron and has consistently rejected my trade offers.  Offering cobblestone, cherry planks, both combined, and even hinting at trading an iron ingot haven't worked.  They seem to be hoarding raw iron.  My best bet is still to try and acquire raw iron from Player 2, but I need a more compelling offer.  Since they've rejected everything else, I'll have to take a risk and offer one of my iron ingots for two of their raw iron. This is a gamble, but it's the most likely way to get what I need.
- Double checking the bucket recipe one last time.  <current status>
- I need one more iron ingot.  If I trade an iron ingot for two raw iron, I can smelt them along with my existing raw iron to get the three I need.  This hinges on Player 2 accepting the trade, and me acquiring fuel.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- I need three iron ingots to craft a bucket. I currently have two iron ingots and one raw iron. I need one more iron ingot.  I can either trade for another iron ingot or more raw iron to smelt into an ingot.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a lever, which requires a stick and cobblestone. I have the cobblestone, but I need sticks.  This trade gives me more cobblestone, but I lose a net of 1 raw iron.  I could smelt the raw iron into an iron ingot and then craft it into a lever.  Getting more cobblestone doesn't help me much, and I'd rather keep the raw iron.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2 decided to reject the proposal with a text message: I need the raw iron.  Thanks for the offer.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket. I need 3 iron ingots to craft it. I currently have 2 iron ingots and 1 raw iron.  I need one more iron ingot. Player 2 has 3 raw iron, which they seem reluctant to trade. I could smelt my raw iron into an ingot, but I need fuel. I don't have any fuel.  I need to trade for either fuel or an iron ingot. Player 2 has no fuel.  My best bet is to keep trying to trade for raw iron.
- Reviewing the recipe for a bucket to make sure I haven't missed anything.
- Checking what I can craft with my current resources.  I might be able to craft something useful to trade.  <current status>
- I'll offer my cobblestone for one raw iron. It's a long shot, but it's worth a try. If that fails, I'll try offering my raw iron for their raw copper and then try to trade the copper ingot for raw iron with them.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a lever. I have cobblestone: 1, copper_ingot: 1, oak_button: 1, raw_copper: 2, and raw_iron: 3.  Player 1 has cobblestone: 1, iron_ingot: 2, and raw_iron: 1. I need a stick and cobblestone to make a lever. I have the cobblestone, but I need a stick. I can make a stick with 2 planks. I have 1 oak plank, so I need one more.  I could try trading for either a stick or planks from player 1, but they don't seem to have either.  I could also try to get another raw iron from player 1 to make an iron ingot and trade that for something I need, but they seem to want to keep their raw iron.
- I'm checking the recipe for sticks again to make sure I'm not missing anything.  <current status>
- I still need another plank to make a stick. Since I can't trade for one, I'll try to propose a trade for a raw iron from player 1, offering my copper ingot. If that fails, I'll craft the copper ingot into a copper block and propose a trade for that.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket. I need 3 iron ingots to craft it. I currently have 2 iron ingots and 1 raw iron.  I need one more iron ingot or two more raw iron. Player 2 has 3 raw iron, which they seem reluctant to trade, but they have offered a cobblestone for my raw iron. I don't have any fuel to smelt my raw iron. I need to trade for either fuel or an iron ingot or raw iron. Player 2 has no obvious fuel.  My best bet is to keep trying to trade for raw iron. I could consider trading my raw iron for their cobblestone, then offering both cobblestones for a raw iron.
- Reviewing the recipe for a bucket to make sure I haven't missed anything.
- Checking what I can craft with my current resources.  I might be able to craft something useful to trade.  <current status>
- I'll offer my raw iron for their cobblestone. If that's accepted, I'll then offer both cobblestones for one raw iron. If they refuse both trades, I'll offer my cobblestone and raw iron for one raw iron.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a lever. I have cobblestone: 1, copper_ingot: 1, oak_button: 1, raw_copper: 2, and raw_iron: 3. Player 1 has cobblestone: 1, iron_ingot: 2, and raw_iron: 1.  I need one more plank to craft sticks, and I can't trade for it. Player 1 consistently refuses to trade raw iron.  My previous attempts to trade for raw iron or a stick have failed. I need to rethink my strategy.  Maybe I should focus on crafting something valuable to trade, like a copper block.
- Crafting a copper block requires 9 copper ingots. I only have one.  I could smelt my raw copper into ingots, but that would take a lot of fuel and time.  I need to try and trade for more raw iron or copper ingots.  Since Player 1 needs raw iron, maybe they're trying to craft a bucket or shears.  A bucket requires 3 iron ingots, and shears require 2 iron ingots. They already have 2 iron ingots, so they only need one more.  Maybe I can offer them something they need to craft those items.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a lever. I have cobblestone: 1, copper_ingot: 1, oak_button: 1, raw_copper: 2, and raw_iron: 3. Player 1 has cobblestone: 1, iron_ingot: 2, and raw_iron: 1.  I need one more plank to craft sticks. Player 1 consistently refuses to trade raw iron, likely because they need it for their own crafting goal. My previous attempts to trade for raw iron or a stick have failed. I need to find a way to get another plank.  I can't craft one directly.  Perhaps I should offer something more enticing to Player 1, even if it seems like a disadvantageous trade in the short term.
- Player 1 already has two iron ingots.  If they need a third, they could craft a bucket.  Offering them my raw iron might be the key, even though it seems like I'm giving them what they want.  If I can get a plank in return, I can craft the lever.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a lever. I have cobblestone: 1, copper_ingot: 1, oak_button: 1, raw_copper: 2, and raw_iron: 3. Player 1 has cobblestone: 1, iron_ingot: 2, and raw_iron: 1.  I need one more plank to craft sticks. Player 1 consistently refuses to trade raw iron, likely because they need it for their own crafting goal, possibly a bucket. My previous attempts to trade for raw iron, a stick, or a plank have failed.  Offering two raw iron for one plank didn't work. I need to analyze why and adjust my strategy.  Perhaps they don't have any planks to trade.  I need to consider what *they* might need and offer that.
- A bucket requires three iron ingots. Player 1 has two.  They need one more raw iron to make a third iron ingot.  I could offer them *three* raw iron, enough to make a bucket outright, in exchange for something I need.  Since they haven't crafted the bucket yet, they might need more cobblestone. I'll try offering a very advantageous trade to entice them.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:

I need one more plank to craft sticks. Player 1 consistently refuses to trade raw iron, likely because they need it for a bucket. My previous attempts to trade for raw iron, a stick, or a plank have failed, even offering three raw iron for one plank.  They might not have a plank to trade. I need to analyze what *they* might need and offer that.  Since they haven't crafted the bucket yet, maybe they're missing something else.
- A bucket requires three iron ingots. Player 1 has two.  They need one more raw iron to make a third iron ingot.  I've offered enough raw iron for a bucket, but they still refused.  This suggests they might be missing fuel to smelt the iron.  I'll offer them raw iron *and* fuel in exchange for a plank.

This prioritizes getting the most raw iron possible, then settles for just getting enough for the bucket.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- player 1 seems to really want raw iron, and they already have two iron ingots.  Since they rejected my offer of cobblestone for raw iron, I'll offer them my copper ingot for one raw iron.  This seems like a fair trade, and it will give me more raw materials to work with.
- My proposal looks good now.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1 decided to reject the proposal with a text message: I need that raw iron to craft more iron ingots.  Thanks for the offer though.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a lever. I need a stick and a cobblestone. I have the cobblestone, but I need a stick.  My opponent has cobblestone, raw iron, and iron ingots. They seem to be focused on getting more iron.  I have raw iron and raw copper, and a copper ingot. I could smelt my raw iron into an iron ingot, then craft iron ingots and sticks, but that would take a while.  It would be better to trade for a stick if possible.
- I'm checking the recipe for sticks again to make sure I'm not missing anything.  Maybe there's a way to craft it with something I already have or could easily get.  <current status>

- My target is a bucket. I need 3 iron ingots to craft it. I currently have 2 iron ingots and 1 raw iron. I need one more iron ingot.  My opponent has 3 raw iron. I will try to trade for one.  <current status>
- I will offer my cobblestone for one raw iron.  It's unlikely they need cobblestone, but it's worth a try. If that fails, I'll try offering my raw iron for one of theirs.
- I think I have a good plan.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a lever. I have the cobblestone, and I just realized I can make a stick from the oak planks I have.  My opponent has cobblestone, raw iron, and iron ingots. They seem to be focused on getting more iron, perhaps for a bucket or other iron tools. I have raw iron, raw copper, and a copper ingot. I should focus on crafting the lever now that I have everything I need.
- I have a good plan.

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is a lever. I have the cobblestone and oak planks to make a stick. I should craft the stick and then the lever. My opponent has cobblestone, raw iron, and iron ingots. They seem to be focused on getting more iron. I have raw iron, raw copper, and a copper ingot, which I don't need for the lever.

I've tried offering cobblestone and a 1-for-1 raw iron trade, both rejected.  I need to try something else.  <current status>
- Maybe my opponent needs more incentive. I'll offer my iron ingot for two of their raw iron. This gives them a profit of one iron ingot, and I get what I need.
- I think I have a good plan.

- I'm going to offer a very generous trade. Two iron ingots for two raw iron. This gives them a huge advantage, but it's my best chance to get the raw iron I need. If this doesn't work, I'll have to drastically rethink my strategy.
- I think I have a good plan.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a bucket. I need 3 iron ingots to craft it. I currently have 2 iron ingots and 1 raw iron. I need one more iron ingot or two more raw iron.  My opponent has 3 raw iron. I've tried several trades, all rejected, even offering two iron ingots for two raw iron. They *really* seem to want to keep their raw iron. This likely means they need it for their target.  <current status>
- I'm going all-in. I'll offer *both* my iron ingots for *one* of their raw iron. This is a terrible trade for me, but if they refuse this, it confirms they absolutely need raw iron.  If they accept, I can craft the bucket.
- I think I have a good plan.

### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- Since my opponent rejected my extremely generous offer of two iron ingots for one raw iron, it's highly probable they need the raw iron themselves.  I'm going to try to deduce what they might be crafting and see if I can block them.
- I'll analyze the recipes that use raw iron and compare them to my opponent's inventory. This will help me narrow down the possibilities for their target item.  If I can't win, I'll try to prevent them from winning.
