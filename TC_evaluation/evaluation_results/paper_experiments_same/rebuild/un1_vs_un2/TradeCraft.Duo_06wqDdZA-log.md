## 🌀 Turn 1 start!
----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I need 3 iron ingots to make a bucket. I have 1 iron ingot, and my opponent has 5 raw iron.  I can smelt raw iron into iron ingots, but I need coal or other fuel. I have 1 coal. I can propose a trade for some raw iron in exchange for my raw copper.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **bucket**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- I need 2 more iron ingots.  My opponent has 5 raw iron. I will offer my raw copper for 2 raw iron.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:raw_copper * 1, ] together with a text message: I need some raw iron to make a bucket. Would you trade 2 raw iron for my raw copper?


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a lever.  A lever requires a cobblestone and a stick. I already have cobblestone.  Sticks are crafted from planks. I have oak planks, so I can make sticks.  Trading away raw iron won't hurt my ability to craft a lever.  Getting more raw copper might be useful later, though it's not immediately necessary.  Since I don't need the raw iron, the trade seems beneficial.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Sounds good. I'll trade you.
