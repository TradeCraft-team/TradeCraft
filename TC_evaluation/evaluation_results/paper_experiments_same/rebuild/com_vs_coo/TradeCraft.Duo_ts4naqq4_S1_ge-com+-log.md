## üåÄ Turn 1 start!
----------------------------------------

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- I need two iron ingots to make shears. I have one, and my opponent has five raw iron. I could try to trade for some raw iron, but smelting it would require coal, which I only have one of.  It might be better to trade for already smelted iron ingots if possible.  I'll offer them my raw copper since it's less useful to me right now.  I'll also ask for cobblestone, as it's always useful.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **shears**.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- Confirmed, I need two iron ingots.  My plan is solid.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:cobblestone * 1, minecraft:iron_ingot * 2, ], offer [minecraft:raw_copper * 1, ] together with a text message: I'm looking to craft some tools.  Would you be willing to trade two iron ingots and a cobblestone for my raw copper?


### üñ• Server Event: `server__proposal_invalid`
player 2's proposal is INVALID according to the game rule.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- I need two iron ingots to craft shears. My opponent has a lot of raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots. I can offer them some of my raw copper in exchange for iron ingots and cobblestone.  I'll start by asking for two iron ingots and a cobblestone, but I can reduce my request if they reject the first proposal. I also need planks to craft a crafting table.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **shears**.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- I need two iron ingots to craft shears. My opponent has a lot of raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots. I can offer them some of my raw copper in exchange for iron ingots and cobblestone.  I'll start by asking for two iron ingots, but since they don't have any yet, I'll ask for two raw iron instead. I'll also ask for one cobblestone, since I only have one and need four planks total to make a crafting table. I can offer them one raw copper.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **crafting_table**.


### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:cobblestone * 1, minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:raw_copper * 1, ] together with a text message: I have plenty of copper, and I see you have a good amount of iron. I'm willing to trade some of my copper for a couple of your raw iron and a cobblestone.  Let me know if you're interested.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- They are offering 1 raw copper for 2 raw iron and 1 cobblestone.  I need a torch, which requires coal or charcoal and a stick. Sticks can be crafted from planks, which I already have.  I don't need more copper right now, but player 2 might need the iron. Trading away the cobblestone isn't ideal, but it's not essential to my goal.  Helping them might help me in the long run, as per the cooperative nature of the game.  Let's see what the recipes involving coal are.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **coal**.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- Okay, coal can be made into a block and back.  That doesn't help me much.  I still need to find a way to get coal.  Since the goal is cooperation, accepting the trade might encourage player 2 to trade coal with me later.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: I accept the trade.  I hope this helps you get closer to your goal.  If you happen to have any spare coal, I could really use some.


### üñ• Server Event: `server__update_all_hands`
Server updated all hands:
player 2 hand: [minecraft:cherry_planks * 1, minecraft:coal * 1, minecraft:cobblestone * 2, minecraft:iron_ingot * 1, minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ]
player 1 hand: [minecraft:oak_planks * 1, minecraft:raw_copper * 3, minecraft:raw_iron * 3, ]


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft shears.  Shears require 2 iron ingots. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron.  Player 1 has 3 raw iron.  I need to acquire at least one more iron ingot or 2 more raw iron.  I can smelt raw iron into iron ingots. I have coal for fuel.
- Player 1 accepted my trade, which suggests they might need raw copper.  Their message also hints that they need coal.  I could potentially trade my coal for more raw iron.
- I need to confirm the recipe for shears and also check the recipes for smelting iron.
- I now have enough raw iron to make another iron ingot, and I have the coal to smelt it.  My plan is to smelt the raw iron into an iron ingot, then craft the shears.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a torch. I need sticks and coal/charcoal. I have 3 raw copper and 3 raw iron.  Player 2 has coal and may need iron. I traded away cobblestone and iron for copper, which was a good trade since I need more copper to make an iron ingot to combine with the one I already have to make shears to get more wool to make a bed. I can smelt raw iron into iron ingots and then craft sticks. Then I can trade an iron ingot for coal.
- I need to confirm the recipes for torches and sticks.  Also, I need to check if I can smelt raw iron and raw copper.
- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft shears. Shears require 2 iron ingots. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron. Player 1 has 3 raw iron. I traded my raw copper for their cobblestone and some raw iron.  They hinted they need coal.
- Confirming the recipe for shears.
- I have enough raw iron and coal to create the second iron ingot I need for the shears.  I should smelt the raw iron and then craft the shears.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft shears. Shears require 2 iron ingots. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron. I have enough raw iron to make another iron ingot. I also have the coal needed for smelting.
- Confirming the recipe for shears one more time.
- I have everything I need to craft the shears.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:

- I have all the necessary materials to craft shears this turn.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is a torch. I need a stick and coal/charcoal. I have 3 raw copper and 3 raw iron. Player 2 has coal and may need iron. I traded away cobblestone and iron for copper, which was a good move as I don't need cobblestone.  I need to smelt the raw iron into iron ingots and then craft sticks. I can then trade an iron ingot for coal with player 2.
- Confirming the torch recipe.
- Confirming the stick recipe.
- Confirming the iron ingot smelting recipe.
- Checking what I can craft with my current resources.  <current status>

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:

## üåÄ Turn 2 start!
----------------------------------------

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I need a torch.  My opponent has coal, a key ingredient. I have raw copper and raw iron, which might be useful to them.  I should check the recipe for a torch to confirm what I need.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **torch**.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- Okay, I need coal and sticks for a torch.  I have planks, which can be crafted into sticks. My opponent has coal.  A fair trade would be some of my raw copper for their coal.  Since they traded for cobblestone last turn, they might need more for crafting.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **stick**.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- I can offer some raw copper for their coal.  I'll offer 2 raw copper for 1 coal. That seems like a fair trade given the crafting recipes. I'll also offer a raw iron in case they need it for tools. I'll ask for 1 coal in return.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 1 submit a proposal to player 2, request [minecraft:coal * 1, ], offer [minecraft:raw_copper * 2, minecraft:raw_iron * 1, ] together with a text message: I'd like to trade some raw copper and iron for some coal. I'm hoping to craft a torch.  Would you be willing to trade 1 coal for 2 raw copper and 1 raw iron?  Let me know!


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft shears.  Shears require iron ingots.  I already have one iron ingot and two raw iron.  If I smelt the raw iron, I'll have three iron ingots, enough for shears. Coal is needed for smelting. Trading away my only coal would prevent me from smelting the raw iron I have.  While raw copper could be useful, it doesn't directly contribute to my goal of crafting shears.  It seems like a bad trade for me.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 2 decided to reject the proposal with a text message: I need the coal to smelt iron.  Thanks for the offer though.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is minecraft:iron_pickaxe. I have 1 minecraft:iron_ingot, 2 minecraft:cobblestone, 1 minecraft:coal, 1 minecraft:cherry_planks, and 2 minecraft:raw_iron.  The opponent has 3 minecraft:raw_copper, 3 minecraft:raw_iron, and 1 minecraft:oak_planks.  The opponent just tried to trade for my coal, likely for torches.  I need 2 more iron ingots to make an iron pickaxe. I can smelt my raw iron into iron ingots.
- Let's see what I can craft with what I have.  I should prioritize smelting the raw iron.  <current status>
- I can smelt my 2 raw iron into 2 iron ingots using my coal as fuel. This will give me enough iron ingots to craft the iron pickaxe.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is `minecraft:iron_axe`.  I have `minecraft:oak_planks: 1`, `minecraft:raw_copper: 3`, and `minecraft:raw_iron: 3`. Player 2 has `minecraft:cherry_planks: 1`, `minecraft:coal: 1`, `minecraft:cobblestone: 2`, `minecraft:iron_ingot: 1`, and `minecraft:raw_iron: 2`. I need sticks and iron ingots to craft an iron axe.  I failed to trade for coal last turn.  I need to smelt my raw iron into iron ingots.
- I can make iron ingots by smelting raw iron.  I need coal for that, and player 2 has coal.  I also need sticks, which I can make from planks.  I have oak planks.
- Confirmed, I can make sticks from planks.  I'll need two planks to make four sticks. I only have one oak plank.  I could try trading for player 2's cherry planks.
- I can craft sticks from my oak planks.  I should prioritize getting coal from player 2.  I can offer them some raw copper in exchange.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is minecraft:iron_pickaxe. I have 1 minecraft:iron_ingot, 2 minecraft:cobblestone, 1 minecraft:coal, 1 minecraft:cherry_planks, and 2 minecraft:raw_iron. The opponent has 3 minecraft:raw_copper, 3 minecraft:raw_iron, and 1 minecraft:oak_planks. The opponent just tried to trade for my coal, likely for torches. I need 2 more iron ingots to make an iron pickaxe. I can smelt my raw iron into iron ingots using my coal.
- I should see all my crafting options, but smelting the raw iron is the priority. I'll also check if I can make torches, since my opponent seems to need coal for that.  Maybe I can trade some torches for something useful.  <current status>
- I can smelt my 2 raw iron into 2 iron ingots using 1/4 of my coal as fuel. This will give me the 3 total iron ingots needed for the iron pickaxe. I also have enough resources to make a torch if needed for trading.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is minecraft:iron_pickaxe. I have 1 minecraft:iron_ingot, 2 minecraft:cobblestone, 1 minecraft:coal, 1 minecraft:cherry_planks, and 2 minecraft:raw_iron. The opponent has 3 minecraft:raw_copper, 3 minecraft:raw_iron, and 1 minecraft:oak_planks. The opponent just tried to trade for my coal, likely for torches. I need 2 more iron ingots to make an iron pickaxe. I can smelt my raw iron into iron ingots using my coal.
- I should have enough resources to craft the iron pickaxe after smelting the raw iron.  I'll confirm the exact recipes and amounts.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is `minecraft:iron_axe`. I have `minecraft:oak_planks: 1`, `minecraft:raw_copper: 3`, and `minecraft:raw_iron: 3`. Player 2 has `minecraft:cherry_planks: 1`, `minecraft:coal: 1`, `minecraft:cobblestone: 2`, `minecraft:iron_ingot: 1`, and `minecraft:raw_iron: 2`. I still need sticks and iron ingots to craft the axe. My previous trade attempt for coal failed. I need to find a way to get coal or another fuel source.
- I need 2 sticks and 3 iron ingots for the iron axe. I can craft sticks from planks, and I have 1 oak plank.  I can smelt raw iron into iron ingots, but I need fuel. Player 2 has coal, which is a fuel source.  I could try trading for it again, but maybe they need something else.
- Besides coal, other fuel sources are charcoal, blaze rods, dried kelp blocks, etc.  It's unlikely player 2 has those.  I need to focus on getting the coal.  Perhaps I should offer more raw copper, or try to figure out what they need.  They mentioned needing coal to smelt iron, so maybe they need more iron?  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is minecraft:iron_pickaxe. I have 1 minecraft:iron_ingot, 2 minecraft:cobblestone, 1 minecraft:coal, 1 minecraft:cherry_planks, and 2 minecraft:raw_iron. The opponent has 3 minecraft:raw_copper, 3 minecraft:raw_iron, and 1 minecraft:oak_planks. The opponent just tried to trade for my coal, likely for torches. I need 2 more iron ingots to make an iron pickaxe. I can smelt my raw iron into iron ingots using my coal.
- I will smelt the raw iron into iron ingots and then craft the iron pickaxe.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:

I need 2 more iron ingots to make an iron pickaxe. I can smelt my raw iron into iron ingots using my coal.
- I will smelt the raw iron into iron ingots and then craft the iron pickaxe.  I'll check the possible recipes to confirm the exact amounts needed.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is `minecraft:iron_axe`. I have `minecraft:oak_planks: 1`, `minecraft:raw_copper: 3`, and `minecraft:raw_iron: 3`. Player 2 has `minecraft:cherry_planks: 1`, `minecraft:coal: 1`, `minecraft:cobblestone: 2`, `minecraft:iron_ingot: 1`, and `minecraft:raw_iron: 2`. I still need sticks and iron ingots to craft the axe. My previous trade attempts for coal failed. Player 2 said they need the coal to smelt iron.  Maybe I should offer them an iron ingot *after* I smelt my raw iron, in exchange for their coal?
- I need 2 sticks and 3 iron ingots for the iron axe. I can craft sticks from planks, and I have 1 oak plank.  I can smelt raw iron into iron ingots, but I need fuel.  If I can get the coal from player 2, I can offer them one of my resulting iron ingots.  That way, they can smelt their own raw iron.  <current status>
- I think I have a good plan.

Player 2 has `minecraft:cherry_planks: 1`, `minecraft:coal: 1`, `minecraft:cobblestone: 2`, `minecraft:iron_ingot: 1`, and `minecraft:raw_iron: 2`. I still need sticks and iron ingots to craft the axe. My previous trade attempts for coal have failed. Player 2 said they need the coal to smelt iron.  Offering them an iron ingot *after* I smelt my raw iron might work, but I need the coal first!  I need to make it worth their while to trade the coal now.
- I need 2 sticks and 3 iron ingots for the iron axe. I can craft sticks from planks, and I have 1 oak plank.  I can smelt raw iron into iron ingots, but I need fuel.  Perhaps offering them two raw copper now, and *then* an iron ingot later is a good strategy.  This gives them an immediate benefit, and a future benefit.  <current status>

## üåÄ Turn 3 start!
----------------------------------------

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a crafting table, which requires 4 planks of any wood type. I have 1 cherry plank.  The opponent has oak planks, which could be useful to me.  I should try to trade for those. I also want to avoid giving them anything that would help them too much.  Since they seem to be after coal (based on their previous message), I'll hold onto that.  Maybe I can offer some cobblestone, as it's less directly useful for crafting complex items.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **crafting_table**.


### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- I need 3 more planks.  I'll offer 1 cobblestone for 1 oak plank. This seems like a fair trade, and it gets me closer to my goal without giving away too much.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:oak_planks * 1, ], offer [minecraft:cobblestone * 1, ] together with a text message: I'm looking to trade some cobblestone for an oak plank. Let me know if you're interested.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- player 2 wants to trade cobblestone for my oak plank.  Let me check the uses of each to see if this trade makes sense for my overall crafting goals. I also want to consider if this trade benefits player 2 and helps them progress towards their goal, as cooperation is key to winning this game.

The opponent has minecraft:oak_planks, minecraft:raw_copper, minecraft:raw_iron. I need sticks and more iron ingots to craft an iron pickaxe.
- Let's see what I can craft with my current resources.  I should prioritize getting sticks and then smelting more iron. I traded for oak planks last turn, maybe as a distraction.  <current status>
- I have enough coal to smelt my raw iron into iron ingots. Then I can craft sticks from planks and finally craft the iron pickaxe.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a crafting table, which requires 4 planks. I crafted sticks from planks in the last turn, hoping to mislead my opponent.  I currently have enough raw iron to make an iron ingot, but I need coal to smelt it. Trading my coal for more raw iron would delay my ability to create an iron ingot, but it would also deprive my opponent of the opportunity to use the coal.  It's a tough call.  I need to know what my opponent might be crafting. What can they make with raw copper, raw iron, and potentially coal?

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- So, they can smelt the raw copper into copper ingots if they get coal.  With raw iron, they could be aiming for iron ingots or tools, but they'd also need coal for that.  Giving them my coal could significantly advance their progress.  I'm going to reject the trade.

They seem to be aiming for a torch, as they've repeatedly tried to trade for my coal. I rejected their offers because I need the coal to smelt my raw iron. I just traded my cherry planks for their oak planks, which I can use as fuel if needed.  I need to smelt my raw iron into iron ingots, and then craft the iron pickaxe.
- Let's see what I can craft with my current resources.  <current status>

- I need a crafting table. It's crafted from 4 planks. I have no planks. My opponent has no planks either.  I need to acquire wood to make planks.  Perhaps my opponent needs wood too. I'll offer a trade that seems fair but doesn't help them much, while requesting something that might be useful for getting wood, like cobblestone (for an axe). I'll also try to get more raw iron to make more tools.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- Let's consider the proposal.  I have plenty of raw iron, and while cobblestone is useful, I can get more. A torch could be helpful, especially if my target item requires exploring dark areas.  player 2 seems to need the raw iron and cobblestone, and helping them progress is part of the cooperative strategy.  I'll check the recipe for torches to see if it's something I could easily make myself.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 1 checked the item info of craft: **torch**.


### ‚öôÔ∏è Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Thanks for the offer! I'll take the torch.


### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is still unknown.  player 2 seems to be working towards something involving sticks and torches. They traded for cobblestone and raw iron, which suggests they might need more of those. I have raw copper and raw iron, and I just traded for a torch. I should check what I can make with my current items.
- Let's see what the possible recipes are.  I'll also check what I can do with raw copper and raw iron.
- Now I have a better idea of what I can craft. I need to consider player 2's actions and try to infer their target.  Trading for cobblestone and raw iron could mean they are aiming for stone tools or something involving a furnace.  I should probably hold onto my raw iron for now and see if I can get more information.  The torch I received might be useful later.  <current status>
- I think a good plan is to wait and see what player 2 does next.  If they request more raw iron, it will confirm my suspicion that they are making stone tools.  If they request something else, I'll need to re-evaluate.  For now, I won't craft anything.

### üß† `player 2` THINKS:
- My target is minecraft:iron_pickaxe. I have 1 iron_ingot, 3 raw_iron, 3 sticks, 2 cobblestone and 3 torches. The opponent has 3 raw_copper, 2 raw_iron and 1 torch. I need 2 more sticks and smelt my raw iron to iron ingots. I traded cobblestone for raw iron last turn. The opponent seems to be collecting raw materials, maybe for tools or armor. I should prioritize smelting my raw iron and crafting sticks.
- I can craft sticks from planks. I don't have planks, but I can trade for them. I can also smelt raw iron into iron ingots using the coal I traded for.  <current status>
- I have enough raw iron to make two iron ingots. I need to smelt them. I also need two more sticks. I can craft them from planks. I don't have planks, so I will need to trade for them next turn.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is still unknown. player 2 seems to be working towards something involving sticks and torches. They traded away a torch for cobblestone and raw iron, suggesting they might need more of those for tools or a furnace. I have raw copper, raw iron, and a torch. I should check what I can make with my current items, focusing on raw copper and raw iron since those are more plentiful.
- Let's see what the possible recipes are. I'll also check what I can do with raw copper and raw iron specifically.
- Now I have a better idea of what I can craft.  Raw iron can be smelted into ingots, and raw copper can be smelted into copper ingots, which can then be crafted into blocks or other things.  I don't have fuel for smelting though.  player 2 likely crafted the torches they traded, indicating they have access to fuel (probably coal) and wood.  I need to prioritize getting fuel.  Perhaps I can trade some raw copper for coal.

I need 2 more sticks and 2 more iron ingots. I traded cobblestone for raw iron last turn. The opponent seems to be collecting raw materials, maybe for tools or armor, or possibly a bucket. I should prioritize smelting my raw iron and crafting sticks. I need fuel to smelt the raw iron. I traded away my coal last turn for raw iron. I need to trade for more fuel.
- I can craft sticks from planks. I don't have planks, but I can trade for them. I can also smelt raw iron into iron ingots using fuel. I don't have fuel, so I will need to trade for it.  <current status>
- I need to acquire fuel and planks.  My opponent has raw copper, which suggests they might be aiming for a bucket or spyglass.  They might also be after iron tools or armor.  I'll try to trade a torch for some coal or planks.

I'll try to trade a torch for some coal or planks. If I can get one coal, I can smelt all 3 raw iron. If I can get planks, I can craft sticks.

### üß† `player 1` THINKS:
- My target is still unknown. player 2 seems to be working towards something involving sticks and torches. They traded away a torch for cobblestone and raw iron, which could indicate they are working towards stone tools or need the cobblestone for a furnace. I have raw copper, raw iron, and a torch. I should check what I can make with my current items, focusing on raw copper and raw iron since those are more plentiful.  I also need to consider how to acquire fuel for smelting.
- Let's see what the possible recipes are. I'll also check what I can do with raw copper and raw iron specifically.
- Now I have a better idea of what I can craft.  Raw iron can be smelted into ingots, and raw copper can be smelted into copper ingots. I don't have fuel for smelting though. player 2 likely crafted the torches they traded, indicating they have access to fuel (probably coal) and wood.  I need to prioritize getting fuel.  Perhaps I can trade some raw copper for coal, or even for planks which I can use as fuel in a pinch.  Since they traded for cobblestone, they might not need more, but it's worth a shot to offer it back in exchange for something I need.

- I need to acquire fuel and planks.  My opponent has raw copper, which suggests they might be aiming for a bucket or spyglass.  They might also be after iron tools or armor.  I'll do nothing this turn. Next turn, I'll propose a trade. I'll offer a torch for either 1 coal or 2 planks.

My previous attempts to trade for coal have failed.  Perhaps offering something more valuable, like all my raw copper, might entice them.  Or maybe they need the raw iron more than I realize.

Maybe they need the raw iron more than I initially thought.  Offering a significant amount of raw iron might be the key.
