## 🌀 Turn 1 start!
----------------------------------------

### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- My goal is to craft a bucket.  Buckets require iron ingots. I already have one iron ingot.  I need two more. My opponent has a lot of raw iron. I should try to trade for some. I also need fuel for the furnace. I have coal, which is a good start.  I'll offer them my cherry planks, as they seem less useful to me right now.  I'll request two raw iron.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__item_info`
player 2 checked the item info of craft: **bucket**.


### 🧠 `player 2` THINKS:
- The item_info confirms that I need 3 iron ingots for a bucket.  My plan to trade for raw iron makes sense.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__submit_proposal`
player 2 submit a proposal to player 1, request [minecraft:raw_iron * 2, ], offer [minecraft:cherry_planks * 1, ] together with a text message: I'd like to trade my cherry planks for two of your raw iron.  Let me know if you're interested.


### 🧠 `player 1` THINKS:
- They are offering 1 cherry plank for 2 raw iron. I need a lever, which requires a stick and cobblestone.  I already have cobblestone. Sticks can be crafted from planks.  This trade would give me planks, which moves me closer to my goal.  It seems like a fair trade, and beneficial to me.  I should accept.

### ⚙️ Player Event: `player__approval_or_reject`
player 1 decided to accept the proposal with a text message: Yes, I'll trade.  I need planks to make sticks.

- My target is a bucket, which requires 3 iron ingots. I currently have 1 iron ingot and 2 raw iron. My opponent has 3 raw iron. I need to obtain 2 more raw iron from them to craft 3 iron ingots.  I traded my cherry planks for 2 raw iron last turn. I need to figure out what they are trying to craft. They said they needed planks for sticks.  I should check what can be crafted with sticks.
- Okay, sticks can be used to craft a lot of things, including tools, torches, and ladders.  It's hard to tell what their target is based on sticks alone.  I have coal, so I don't think they need it for torches.  I should focus on getting the iron I need. I'll offer them my cobblestone for one of their raw iron.  It's not essential for me, and they might need it for something.  <current status>
- I have a good plan.
