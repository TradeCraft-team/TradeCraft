However, they did not proactively propose an alternative trade or explore other avenues to acquire coal.  Their rejection was well-reasoned, but their overall strategy could have been more proactive."

Despite having the necessary resources to craft a torch, they were unable to execute the crafting steps correctly and ultimately lost the game. Their strategic planning was ineffective in achieving their objective.  They seem to have misunderstood the crafting recipe for sticks."
