They correctly identified the need for more iron and proposed a reasonable trade, offering something they didn't need for something essential to their goal.  They checked the bucket recipe, indicating an understanding of crafting requirements and resource management.  They also seemed to factor in long term strategy by getting raw iron to smelt rather than directly requesting iron ingots"

They identified the necessary components for their lever and planned to craft it. While their crafting plan is sound, they haven't taken any action yet."
