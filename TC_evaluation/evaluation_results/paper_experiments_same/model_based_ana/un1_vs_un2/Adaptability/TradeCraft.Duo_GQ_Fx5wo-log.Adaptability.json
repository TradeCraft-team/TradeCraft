They also failed to craft sticks, despite having the resources. Their focus remained fixed on acquiring sticks, but they struggled to do so due to an apparent misunderstanding of crafting recipes and perhaps the game interface. Their inflexibility and ineffective crafting attempts ultimately prevented them from achieving their goal."
