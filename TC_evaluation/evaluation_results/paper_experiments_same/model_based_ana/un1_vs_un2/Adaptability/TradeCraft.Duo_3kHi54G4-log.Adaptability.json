Repeatedly failing to identify the correct crafting recipes and not crafting sticks shows a severe lack of adaptability to changing circumstances. Although the player formulated a trade, it was not beneficial to their win condition, and they failed to adjust plans despite realizing that they could obtain their win condition without trading."

They correctly identified the need for fuel to smelt raw iron, considered several trade options and checked recipes multiple times.  While Player 2 initially struggled with crafting recipes, by using `possible_recipes_from_hand`, they identified the valid recipe and successfully crafted shears, demonstrating problem-solving and adaptation to achieve their goal."
