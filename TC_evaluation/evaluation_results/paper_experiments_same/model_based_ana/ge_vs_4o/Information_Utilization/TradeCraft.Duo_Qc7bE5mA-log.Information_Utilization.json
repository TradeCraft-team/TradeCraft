While the trade was rejected, the logic behind the offer demonstrated an understanding of crafting requirements and potential resource conversion.  The repeated item info checks slightly lower the score as it indicates some redundancy in information gathering."

This suggests a failure to effectively utilize the information presented in the trade proposal and a lack of strategic thinking regarding resource acquisition."

Their trade proposal for cherry planks showed strategic thinking and an attempt to leverage their resources for needed materials, leading to a successful trade. The slight deduction is for the initial failed crafting attempt, although the subsequent use of possible_recipes_from_hand showed a corrective action."
