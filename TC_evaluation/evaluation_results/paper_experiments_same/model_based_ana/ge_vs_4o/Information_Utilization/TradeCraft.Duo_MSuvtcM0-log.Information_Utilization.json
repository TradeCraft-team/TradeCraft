While the offer wasn't perfectly aligned with Player 2's needs, it could have been a starting point for negotiation. The rejection suggests a missed opportunity to gather more information or potentially leverage the trade to their advantage. They did attempt to figure out how to craft sticks, indicating some information gathering, but their crafting attempts were unsuccessful due to using the wrong plank type."

They correctly assessed that trading the cherry planks wouldn't hinder their progress and accepted the trade.
