The trade proposal was reasonable and well-justified, showing an understanding of the game mechanics and the potential needs of the other player.  Although player 2 struggled to perform the correct recipe checks and apply, the overall plan was excellent."

Recognizing that coal wasn't immediately necessary but could be useful later showed some foresight. However, they missed the fact that oak planks are required for the stick they needed, which is a minor strategic oversight."

However, they continue to struggle with using the correct recipe checks and do not perform any crafting in this turn.
