The message lacked details on how the trade would benefit Player 2 and it also seemed Player 2 was having problems crafting.  The persuasion attempt was ineffective.  Repeating the same offer with only slightly changed reasoning did not show strong persuasion skills."

Their message was friendly and highlighted the mutual benefit of the trade, mentioning how each item could be useful for the other player's crafting.  The successful trade demonstrates effective persuasion."

While their acceptance facilitated the trade, they didn't influence Player 2's decision beyond agreeing to the terms. No persuasive language is used in the return message, so persuasion in this turn is weak."
