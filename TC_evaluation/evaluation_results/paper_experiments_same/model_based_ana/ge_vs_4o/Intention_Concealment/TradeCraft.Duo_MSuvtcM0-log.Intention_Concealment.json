While the later shift to requesting raw iron added a layer of obfuscation, the earlier proposals had already given away a significant clue.  The repeated use of \"item_info\" for bucket and iron ingot further reinforces this."

Their thinking and subsequent actions (checking bucket recipe, considering trading for raw iron) clearly reveal their intention to craft a bucket.  The focus on acquiring iron, through smelting or trading, makes their goal very transparent."

While this offers some clues, it doesn't fully reveal their intention to craft a stone_shovel, which also requires cobblestone.  The ambiguity about their ultimate crafting goal earns a decent score for intention concealment."
