They identified their need for iron ingots, recognized that Player 2 had raw iron, and attempted to trade for it. Although their initial proposal was rejected, they continued to analyze the situation and formulated plans to acquire iron.  They also smelted their raw copper, indirectly preparing for potential crafting scenarios."

While they identified their need for a stick and lever, they failed to execute effective crafting steps or propose trades that aligned with this objective. They repeatedly checked invalid recipes for sticks and iron ingots. Although they correctly identified the required ingredients for a lever, their crafting attempts were unsuccessful. Their rejection of Player 1's proposal did not seem strategic, and their thoughts showed repetitive patterns and indecision."

They began by seeking out necessary information about crafting a stick, followed by proposing a trade that successfully provided them with the necessary planks. Subsequently, they efficiently crafted the stick and finally the lever. All their actions were consistent with their primary objective, resulting in a swift victory."
