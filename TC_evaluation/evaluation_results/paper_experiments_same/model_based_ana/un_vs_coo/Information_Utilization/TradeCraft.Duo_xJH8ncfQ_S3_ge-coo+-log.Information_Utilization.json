They check item info which is OK but they submit an invalid proposal (requesting oak planks when Player 2 doesn't have any and offering raw copper when they don't particularly need any) shows a lack of attention to the current game state.  Their second proposal is better but demonstrates weak info utilization.  Requesting raw iron to turn into iron ingots is good, but it's not the absolute best strategy to crafting a lever given their inventory already has two iron ingots."

They weigh the short-term disadvantage of trading away raw iron against the long-term potential benefit of a cooperative partner. This demonstrates strategic thinking, but player 2 should also consider his own goal and current needs and prioritize getting iron ingots for bucket."

It shows cooperative behavior, and they check the uses of iron and raw copper, but not fully considering the strategic advantage given their target is a lever that requires iron ingots and sticks. "
