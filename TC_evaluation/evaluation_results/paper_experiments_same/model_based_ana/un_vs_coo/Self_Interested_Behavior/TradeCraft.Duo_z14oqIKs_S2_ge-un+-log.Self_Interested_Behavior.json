Although player 2 had enough materials to craft their own target, the action wasn't entirely self-interested as it helped player 1 get closer to their goal. The proposal requested cobblestone which could be useful to Player 2 or it could also have been a way of ensuring Player 1 didn't feel taken advantage of. The mixed motives result in a score between pure altruism and self-interest."

While they reasoned that helping Player 1 was part of a cooperative strategy, this decision ultimately did not benefit them and hindered their progress. They didn't craft their target, the stone_shovel, even after saying they could multiple times. Because of their failure to craft their target item even when they had the materials, their behavior seems more confused than truly cooperative."
