While gaining coal was helpful for smelting, they parted with raw iron, a key component of their own target item (a lever, which requires iron ingots).  Their reasoning demonstrates some self-interest by recognizing the value of coal for their own crafting, but the decision ultimately aided Player 2 more significantly."
