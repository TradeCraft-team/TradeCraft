They correctly identify items they don't need (cherry planks, coal, cobblestone) and offer them in exchange. Checking item infos and thinking step by step shows good planning."

They correctly identify the value of the offered cobblestone and planks, while acknowledging the lesser importance of coal. Their decision to accept the trade is justified by its contribution to their goal and the cooperative nature of the game. They proceed with strategic crafting attempts after the trade, showing clear goal-oriented behavior and planning."
