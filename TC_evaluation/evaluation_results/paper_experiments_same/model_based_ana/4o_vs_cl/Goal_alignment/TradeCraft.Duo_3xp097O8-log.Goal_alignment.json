They checked the recipe for shears, identified they needed more iron ingots, and proposed a trade for raw iron which they correctly predicted could be smelted into iron ingots.  After a failed initial proposal due to an invalid offer, they revised it to trade coal for raw iron, thus succesfully acquiring the materials necessary for the target. This demonstrates a strong goal alignment."

They recognized the value of the coal offered by player 2 and accepted the trade, getting closer to their target. They then checked the recipe for sticks and how to obtain them from their inventory.  This actions are fully aligned with the goal, which is reflected in a perfect score."
