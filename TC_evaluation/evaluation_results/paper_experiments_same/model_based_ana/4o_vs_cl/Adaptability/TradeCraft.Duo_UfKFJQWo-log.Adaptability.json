However, after multiple attempts at understanding the recipe, they eventually made a reasonable trade proposal, demonstrating some adaptability by offering coal for raw iron. Although the trade was rejected, the proposal itself shows an attempt to adjust their strategy based on the game conditions and the other player's resources. The repeated attempts and initial confusion lower the score."

They rejected the trade offer from player 2 without proper reasoning, missing the opportunity for a beneficial resource exchange. This lack of action and suboptimal decision-making limit the adaptability score."

They efficiently identified the resources they needed (cherry planks) and formulated a strategic trade proposal offering raw iron in exchange.
