They recognized that the cherry planks could be valuable for their own crafting, potentially related to their target item, and prioritized keeping them.

Despite needing the planks earlier, they rejected this offer, seemingly solely due to repetition limit issues. They ended up crafting slabs from cobblestone which served no clear purpose in pursuit of their target item and may hinder the pursuit of the target lever."
