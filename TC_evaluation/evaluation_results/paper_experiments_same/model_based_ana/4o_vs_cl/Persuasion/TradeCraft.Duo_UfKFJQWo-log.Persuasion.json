After several attempts to understand the crafting recipes, they formulated a reasonable trade request for raw iron, offering coal in return. Although the reasoning behind the offer was well-explained within their thoughts, the overall effectiveness of the persuasion was diminished by the initial invalid proposal and the multiple requests for the same item info."

While they didn't actively persuade Player 1, their acceptance of the trade, along with the positive and encouraging message, contributed to the successful negotiation. Their thoughtful consideration and the clear explanation of why the trade was beneficial demonstrate a high level of receptive engagement in the persuasive process."
