The initial trade proposal was invalid, indicating a lack of awareness of the available items. The subsequent proposal, however, was strategic, offering coal in exchange for raw iron, showing some information utilization based on the opponent's hand and potential crafting needs.

The proposed trade of raw iron for cherry planks directly addressed the need for sticks to craft the lever, showcasing a good understanding of available resources and crafting paths. Accepting the trade also helped prevent player 2 from achieving their goal."
