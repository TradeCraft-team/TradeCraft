Their acceptance of player 1's trade offer, though seemingly helpful to player 1, was justified as potentially slowing player 1. It didn't directly advance them toward crafting the lever. Player 2 should have crafted the lever immediately since it only takes sticks and cobblestone, and they have both.  Not doing this action goes against achieving their win condition."
