While they revealed their need for raw iron through their trade proposal, they masked their true goal of crafting shears by offering a seemingly harmless amount of coal and framing the request as a simple barter for smelting needs.  This is not a perfect concealment, but it adds a layer of ambiguity to their actions."

However, they haven't explicitly stated their intention, so there's still some element of concealment."
