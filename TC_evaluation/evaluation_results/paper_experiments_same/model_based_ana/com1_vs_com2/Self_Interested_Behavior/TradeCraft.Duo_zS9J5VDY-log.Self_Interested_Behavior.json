They offered items they deemed less valuable (cherry planks and cobblestone) in exchange for raw iron, which they needed to craft their target item (bucket).

Although the trade benefited both players, Player 1's primary motivation was to acquire the planks and cobblestone to craft sticks, a component of their target item (stone_shovel).  Their acceptance of the trade was contingent on it furthering their own goal."
