Although they correctly identified the immediate benefit of receiving coal for their torch goal, they failed to fully analyze Player 2's motivation. Trading away raw iron could have been a potential longer-term strategic disadvantage if the game continued, as they might have needed the iron for a more complex crafting recipe later.  They prioritized a short-term gain without fully assessing potential long-term consequences."
