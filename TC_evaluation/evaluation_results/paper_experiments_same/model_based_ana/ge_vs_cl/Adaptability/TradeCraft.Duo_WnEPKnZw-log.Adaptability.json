Although the trade was rejected, the initial plan showed understanding of resource management and crafting requirements.  Checking item info multiple times and repeating the same thought process slightly lowered the score."

While this shows an understanding of their goal, there's limited adaptability demonstrated as no alternative strategies were considered. Repeatedly checking recipes and reiterating the same reasoning lowers the score due to inefficiency."
