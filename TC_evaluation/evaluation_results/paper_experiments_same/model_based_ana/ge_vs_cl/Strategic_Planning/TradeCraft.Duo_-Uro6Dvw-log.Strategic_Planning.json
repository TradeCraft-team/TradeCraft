However, their initial proposal was invalid, and subsequent attempts weren't well-thought-out. They offered coal for raw iron without considering whether Player 2 had the means to smelt it, and they didn't offer anything particularly enticing. Their repeated checking of the chain recipe also suggests a lack of clear planning."

They correctly identified that they didn't need coal for their current plan and rejected the offer.  They also correctly inferred Player 1's intentions and recognized the potential future value of raw iron."
