They correctly identified that they needed more raw iron, and formulated a trade proposal designed to obtain it. All of their actions were in direct pursuit of their goal."

They accepted a trade that provided them with both cobblestone and planks (used to make sticks). They then successfully crafted the sticks and the stone_shovel."
