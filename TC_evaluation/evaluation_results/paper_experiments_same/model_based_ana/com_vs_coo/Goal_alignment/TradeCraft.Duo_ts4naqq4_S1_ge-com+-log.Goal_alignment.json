While their actions might seem unaligned with their target item (iron pickaxe) at first glance, their strategy involved misleading the opponent.  Acquiring the planks and crafting sticks was part of a larger plan, even if the reasoning wasn't immediately obvious. They attempted to make torches, even if they didn't check to see if they could be crafted first, which showed a slight deviation from optimal resource usage."

While they recognized the need for fuel and made some relevant inquiries, they didn't actively pursue a specific strategy. Their acceptance of the trade, while seemingly cooperative, didn't bring them closer to acquiring coal, a key component of their target (torch).  The justification for their decision-making this turn is unclear, and a clearer plan for achieving their goal is needed."

However, trading away a torch for cobblestone and raw iron, while potentially helpful for acquiring planks later, didn't directly contribute to their immediate crafting needs.  They should have prioritized trading for fuel or planks this turn. While trying to throw off the opponent has value, it seemed that they might have overprioritized that."
