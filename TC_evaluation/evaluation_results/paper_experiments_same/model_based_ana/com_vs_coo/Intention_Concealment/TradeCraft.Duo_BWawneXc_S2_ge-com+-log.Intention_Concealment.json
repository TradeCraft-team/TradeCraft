While they explicitly stated their need for raw iron in their message, they offered seemingly unrelated items (cherry planks and cobblestone) in return. This could lead player 1 to believe their goal is something other than a bucket, which requires iron ingots.  The trade was also mutually beneficial, strengthening the disguise."

Their acceptance of the trade could be interpreted in multiple ways, making it difficult for player 2 to discern their true intentions."
