Although the initial proposals were invalid, the player persisted and attempted to find a mutually beneficial trade.  The offers of coal and cobblestone to help player 2 process raw iron into ingots indicated an understanding of the game mechanics and a desire to collaborate, despite the initial setbacks.  The repeated item_info checks for shears and iron_ingot further emphasized the player's focused approach towards achieving a shared goal."

Rejecting a null trade was reasonable, and the player expressed a need for coal, potentially opening the door for future negotiations. However, there was limited opportunity for active cooperation due to the circumstances."
