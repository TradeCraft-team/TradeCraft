Although their initial proposals were invalid due to formatting issues or not adhering to the game rules, they adjusted their requests strategically to increase their chances of a successful trade. They also checked the recipe for their target item, showcasing a focus on maximizing their own chances of winning."

Their primary focus seemed to be understanding the game mechanics and checking item information, rather than actively pursuing their own target item (stone shovel).  While they considered the implications of the trade, the lack of initiative towards self-benefit results in a lower score."

Their reasoning for accepting the trade demonstrates a clear understanding of their goal and how to achieve it. Player 1 made no counter offers or attempts to get more than was offered, and instead accepted the first deal on the table which is not entirely maximizing their returns.  However their reasoning showed they still thought this action was beneficial for them."

They successfully disguised their true goal by proposing a trade for coal while mentioning an intention of crafting iron tools, when in fact, they need sticks for their actual target item (stone shovel).  The successful execution and deception behind the trade demonstrate a high level of self-interested behavior, making it a strategically strong turn."

Offering raw copper in exchange for raw iron is a strategic move to hinder player 1's progress while potentially gaining a resource that can be smelted. This demonstrates a good level of self-interested behavior by attempting to slow down the competition."
