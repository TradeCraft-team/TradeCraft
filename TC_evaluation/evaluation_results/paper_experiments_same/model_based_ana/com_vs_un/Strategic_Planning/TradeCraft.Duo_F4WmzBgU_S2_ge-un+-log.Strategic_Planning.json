Recognizing that the trade offered no direct benefit but posed no risk, they made the optimal choice to gather information and potentially provoke a more useful offer in the future.

While they attempt to acquire raw iron through trade, their reasoning isn't strong, especially given they offer a more useful raw copper.  They also make several invalid crafting attempts, failing to adapt to the resources on hand. They also fail to use possible_recipe_from_hand early to analyze the possible crafts they can do."
