However, their initial proposals were invalid, indicating a lack of understanding of the game rules or a failure to plan the trade effectively.  They eventually made a valid proposal, but it was rejected.  They show an understanding of their goal and the need to acquire specific resources but struggled with execution."

They correctly identified that trading raw iron for coal wouldn't help them achieve their goal and recognized the potential risk of helping their opponent. Their rejection of the trade and focus on their own crafting goal shows effective strategic planning."

This demonstrates a significant failure in execution and strategic follow-through."
