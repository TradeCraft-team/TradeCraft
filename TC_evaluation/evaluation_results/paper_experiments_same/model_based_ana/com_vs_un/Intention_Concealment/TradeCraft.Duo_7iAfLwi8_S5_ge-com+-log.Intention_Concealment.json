While they explicitly stated their need for raw iron in the trade proposal message, the overall goal (crafting a chain) remained hidden.  Requesting only raw iron could lead player 1 to believe player 2 is aiming to craft something simpler, like an iron tool.  The offer of less valuable items (cobblestone, planks) strengthens this misdirection."

They did not reveal their need for a lever, and their acceptance message ('Thanks for the trade!') offers no information about their plans.  By focusing on the immediate value of the trade (cobblestone and planks), player 1 avoids hinting at their true goal."
