It shows a mix of self-interest and willingness to cooperate. Although they stated their own goal (stone shovel), their justification for accepting the trade was to obtain coal for future needs rather than the immediate necessity. This indicates forward-thinking but perhaps a slightly less aggressive pursuit of their immediate goal."
