They clearly explained their needs, offered a mutually beneficial trade, and attempted to establish cooperation by asking about Player 1's target item. While the initial proposals were invalid, the final proposal was well-reasoned and successfully persuaded Player 1 to accept the trade.  The detailed explanation of how the trade would help both players achieve their goals was particularly effective."
