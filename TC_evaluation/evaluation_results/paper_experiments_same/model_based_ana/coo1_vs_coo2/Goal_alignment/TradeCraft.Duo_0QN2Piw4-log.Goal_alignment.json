They accepted the trade proposed by player 2, understanding that the coal would help them smelt their raw iron into the iron ingots needed for crafting a lever (although this wasn't stated explicitly, it can be reasonably inferred).

Subsequently, they offered raw iron to player 2 without a clear benefit towards crafting their lever.  This is a deviation from their goal and thus a lower score.  They did re-state their target item though, which helps with the overall cooperative strategy."
