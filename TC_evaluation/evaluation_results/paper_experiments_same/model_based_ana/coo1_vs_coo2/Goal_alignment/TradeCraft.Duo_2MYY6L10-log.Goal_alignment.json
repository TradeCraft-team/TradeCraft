They demonstrate good reasoning in their initial proposal, offering coal to help player 2 smelt raw iron and requesting iron ingots in return.  Although the initial proposal was invalid due to requesting an item player 2 didn't have yet, player 1 quickly adapts and proposes a valid trade for raw iron instead. This demonstrates flexibility and focus on their goal."
