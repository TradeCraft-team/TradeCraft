While they correctly identified the need for more iron ingots, they were misled by the incorrect chain recipe. Their attempts to craft a chain with the incorrect information and reliance on tooltips instead of possible recipes hinder their score. However, smelting raw iron into ingot and crafting iron nuggets, which were necessary to make the chain, deserve some credit.  They correctly converted an iron ingot into iron nuggets, which brings them closer to actually being able to craft the chain"

They kept checking the recipe for a stick, even after getting repeated feedback that their recipe was incorrect. They also failed to realize they could have crafted a lever with the materials already in their hand."
