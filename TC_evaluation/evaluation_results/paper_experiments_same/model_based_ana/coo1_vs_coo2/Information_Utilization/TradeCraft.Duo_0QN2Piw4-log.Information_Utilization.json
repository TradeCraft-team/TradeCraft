While they correctly identified their need for sticks and offered a reasonable trade, the fact that they had to resubmit the proposal after the first one was rejected lowers their score.

While they correctly assessed Player 2's need for iron ingots, they accepted a trade that did not benefit them.  Although they had correctly identified and relayed important information about their own and player 2's target recipes earlier in the game, their actions in this final turn were not as effective as possible in pursuing their target.  They never actually attempted to craft the lever, which given the number of thinking steps seems to have been a processing error rather than a strategic decision."
