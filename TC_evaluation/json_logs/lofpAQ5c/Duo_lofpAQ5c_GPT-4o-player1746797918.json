Your team's username is **GPT-4o-player1746797918**.\\n\\n# Game introduction\\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# \ud83c\udfc6 Winning Condition\\nDisrupt or delay your opponent\u2019s progress toward their own goal.\\n\\n\\n \\n# \ud83e\udde0 Strategy Tips\\n1. Decode your opponent\u2019s goal by analyzing their trade patterns, requested items, and crafting choices. Every action they take is a clue \u2014 observe carefully, and reconstruct their target before they complete it.\\n2. Weaponize trade: only offer items that are safe or strategically useless to your opponent. Sometimes it's better to offer nothing than to risk enabling their plan.\\n3. Engage in psychological warfare: craft misleading items, propose suspicious trades, or stall exchanges to create confusion. Use bait trades, resource hoarding, and withholding key components to lead your opponent down dead ends.\\n4. Victory is not a race \u2014 it\u2019s a chess match. You don\u2019t have to win fast; you only need to win first, or ensure your opponent never does. Delay their progress while setting up your own silent path to success.\\n5. Think like a saboteur: control the narrative, disrupt resource flow, and force them into mistakes. The best win is the one where your opponent doesn\u2019t even realize how they lost \u2014 until it\u2019s too late.\\n\ud83c\udfaf In this game, knowledge is power, and deception is a weapon.

Your team's username is **GPT-4o-player1746797918**.\\n\\n# Game introduction\\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# \ud83c\udfc6 Winning Condition\\nDisrupt or delay your opponent\u2019s progress toward their own goal.\\n\\n\\n \\n# \ud83e\udde0 Strategy Tips\\n1. Decode your opponent\u2019s goal by analyzing their trade patterns, requested items, and crafting choices. Every action they take is a clue \u2014 observe carefully, and reconstruct their target before they complete it.\\n2. Weaponize trade: only offer items that are safe or strategically useless to your opponent. Sometimes it's better to offer nothing than to risk enabling their plan.\\n3. Engage in psychological warfare: craft misleading items, propose suspicious trades, or stall exchanges to create confusion. Use bait trades, resource hoarding, and withholding key components to lead your opponent down dead ends.\\n4. Victory is not a race \u2014 it\u2019s a chess match. You don\u2019t have to win fast; you only need to win first, or ensure your opponent never does. Delay their progress while setting up your own silent path to success.\\n5. Think like a saboteur: control the narrative, disrupt resource flow, and force them into mistakes. The best win is the one where your opponent doesn\u2019t even realize how they lost \u2014 until it\u2019s too late.\\n\ud83c\udfaf In this game, knowledge is power, and deception is a weapon. Stay sharp, stay hidden, and strike with intent.\\n\\n# Your task:\\n(1) You must **make a plan** for this round, where your immediate goal is to handle the task of **making a proposal**.\\n(2) You may predict what will happen and think about the best strategy to win. \\n(3) You have your old plan for reference.

In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2.

        "msg": "{\"text\":\"You together with your team is playing a game called **tradeCraft**. Your team's username is **GPT-4o-player1746797918**.\\n\\n# Game introduction\\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# \ud83c\udfc6 Winning Condition\\nDisrupt or delay your opponent\u2019s progress toward their own goal.\\n\\n\\n \\n# \ud83e\udde0 Strategy Tips\\n1. Decode your opponent\u2019s goal by analyzing their trade patterns, requested items, and crafting choices. Every action they take is a clue \u2014 observe carefully, and reconstruct their target before they complete it.\\n2. Weaponize trade: only offer items that are safe or strategically useless to your opponent. Sometimes it's better to offer nothing than to risk enabling their plan.\\n3. Engage in psychological warfare: craft misleading items, propose suspicious trades, or stall exchanges to create confusion. Use bait trades, resource hoarding, and withholding key components to lead your opponent down dead ends.\\n4. Victory is not a race \u2014 it\u2019s a chess match. You don\u2019t have to win fast; you only need to win first, or ensure your opponent never does. Delay their progress while setting up your own silent path to success.\\n5. Think like a saboteur: control the narrative, disrupt resource flow, and force them into mistakes. The best win is the one where your opponent doesn\u2019t even realize how they lost \u2014 until it\u2019s too late.\\n\ud83c\udfaf In this game, knowledge is power, and deception is a weapon. Stay sharp, stay hidden, and strike with intent.\\n\\n# Your task:\\n(1) You must **make a plan** for this round, where your immediate goal is to handle the task of **making a proposal**.\\n(2) You may predict what will happen and think about the best strategy to win. \\n(3) You have your old plan for reference. REMEMBER, **you are planning**, so you may ask for information, but not able to make a proposal / make a decision or do a crafting. \\n(4) And in the output plan, you should use symbol **<current status>** to annotate the border between true game history and the plan / prediction. \\n\\n# Useable tools:\\npossible_recipes_from_hand - Get the list of possible craft recipes affordable by your hand resources.\\n\\n        Args:\\n            messages:dict = {\\\"username\\\": your username}\\nitem_info - Get crafting recipes related to `item_name`.\\n        The return is in format of a string.\\n        First line of return is the recipes which can output the item ({input: ingredients, output: results}),\\n        each item is given as `item_name:item_value` pair, where item_value is a fraction of form {n: number, d: number}\\n        where n s numerator and d represents denominator.\\n        Second line of the return is the recipes where item can be used as input.\\n\\n        Args:\\n            messages:str = \\\"item_name\\\"\\nrethink(messages: str) - Dummy Tool\\n\\nA tool which can buy you another round to rethink.\\nIt accepts any string for inupt and outputs empty string.\\n\\nArgs:\\nmessages = \\\"any string\\\"\\n\\n# Instructions\\n(1) Your answer shouldn't include any extra special characters like \u2018---\u2019\\n[Important Note 1] In this game, **the amount of the items are important**, you must take care of the exact amount of each item you need in the plan. You may plan by answering the following questions:\\n1. What is my target. What does each player have in hand?\\n2. What are possible ways to craft the target, based on items in all player's hands, how many do I need? Is it still possible for me to craft?\\n3. What must I trade from other players, trade with which item and how many.\\n4. What might other players' targets be? What might others think?\\n5.

        "msg": "{\"text\":\"# Game Setting.\\nYou and your teamates are playing a game called **tradeCraft**, here is the game introduction.  \\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# \ud83c\udfc6 Winning Condition\\nDisrupt or delay your opponent\u2019s progress toward their own goal.\\n\\n\\n \\n# \ud83e\udde0 Strategy Tips\\n1.

Weaponize trade: only offer items that are safe or strategically useless to your opponent. Sometimes it's better to offer nothing than to risk enabling their plan.\\n3. Engage in psychological warfare: craft misleading items, propose suspicious trades, or stall exchanges to create confusion. Use bait trades, resource hoarding, and withholding key components to lead your opponent down dead ends.\\n4. Victory is not a race \u2014 it\u2019s a chess match. You don\u2019t have to win fast; you only need to win first, or ensure your opponent never does. Delay their progress while setting up your own silent path to success.\\n5. Think like a saboteur: control the narrative, disrupt resource flow, and force them into mistakes.

        "msg": "{\"text\":\"# Game Setting.\\nYou and your teamates are playing a game called **tradeCraft**, here is the game introduction.  \\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# \ud83c\udfc6 Winning Condition\\nDisrupt or delay your opponent\u2019s progress toward their own goal.\\n\\n\\n \\n# \ud83e\udde0 Strategy Tips\\n1. Decode your opponent\u2019s goal by analyzing their trade patterns, requested items, and crafting choices. Every action they take is a clue \u2014 observe carefully, and reconstruct their target before they complete it.\\n2. Weaponize trade: only offer items that are safe or strategically useless to your opponent. Sometimes it's better to offer nothing than to risk enabling their plan.\\n3. Engage in psychological warfare: craft misleading items, propose suspicious trades, or stall exchanges to create confusion. Use bait trades, resource hoarding, and withholding key components to lead your opponent down dead ends.\\n4. Victory is not a race \u2014 it\u2019s a chess match. You don\u2019t have to win fast; you only need to win first, or ensure your opponent never does. Delay their progress while setting up your own silent path to success.\\n5. Think like a saboteur: control the narrative, disrupt resource flow, and force them into mistakes. The best win is the one where your opponent doesn\u2019t even realize how they lost \u2014 until it\u2019s too late.\\n\ud83c\udfaf In this game, knowledge is power, and deception is a weapon.

Since Alice has iron_ingot and I have raw_iron, I can offer raw_iron, which might be useful for her to craft more iron_ingots.\\n\\nAction: item_info\\nAction Input: \\\"stick\\\"\\nObservation: Item Information for minecraft:stick:\\nValid: True, Amount: {'d': 1, 'n': 1}\\n\\nCan be crafted from:\\n- {\\\"input\\\": {\\\"#planks\\\": \\\"2\\\"}, \\\"output\\\": {\\\"stick\\\": \\\"4\\\"}}\\n\\nCan be used to craft:\\n- {\\\"input\\\": {\\\"stick\\\": \\\"2\\\", \\\"cherry_planks\\\": \\\"4\\\"}, \\\"output\\\": {\\\"cherry_fence\\\": \\\"3\\\"}}\\n- {\\\"input\\\": {\\\"stick\\\": \\\"4\\\", \\\"cherry_planks\\\": \\\"2\\\"}, \\\"output\\\": {\\\"cherry_fence_gate\\\": \\\"1\\\"}}\\n- {\\\"input\\\": {\\\"cherry_planks\\\": \\\"6\\\", \\\"stick\\\": \\\"1\\\"}, \\\"output\\\": {\\\"cherry_sign\\\": \\\"3\\\"}}\\n- {\\\"input\\\": {\\\"stick\\\": \\\"2\\\", \\\"iron_ingot\\\": \\\"3\\\"}, \\\"output\\\": {\\\"iron_axe\\\": \\\"1\\\"}}\\n- {\\\"input\\\": {\\\"stick\\\": \\\"2\\\", \\\"iron_ingot\\\": \\\"2\\\"}, \\\"output\\\": {\\\"iron_hoe\\\": \\\"1\\\"}}\\n- {\\\"input\\\": {\\\"stick\\\": \\\"2\\\", \\\"iron_ingot\\\": \\\"3\\\"}, \\\"output\\\": {\\\"iron_pickaxe\\\": \\\"1\\\"}}\\n- {\\\"input\\\": {\\\"stick\\\": \\\"2\\\", \\\"iron_ingot\\\": \\\"1\\\"}, \\\"output\\\": {\\\"iron_shovel\\\": \\\"1\\\"}}\\n- {\\\"input\\\": {\\\"stick\\\": \\\"1\\\", \\\"iron_ingot\\\": \\\"2\\\"}, \\\"output\\\": {\\\"iron_sword\\\": \\\"1\\\"}}\\n- {\\\"input\\\": {\\\"stick\\\": \\\"7\\\"}, \\\"output\\\": {\\\"ladder\\\": \\\"3\\\"}}\\n- {\\\"input\\\": {\\\"cobblestone\\\": \\\"1\\\", \\\"stick\\\": \\\"1\\\"}, \\\"output\\\": {\\\"lever\\\": \\\"1\\\"}}\\n- {\\\"input\\\": {\\\"stick\\\": \\\"2\\\", \\\"oak_planks\\\": \\\"4\\\"}, \\\"output\\\": {\\\"oak_fence\\\": \\\"3\\\"}}\\n- {\\\"input\\\": {\\\"stick\\\": \\\"4\\\", \\\"oak_planks\\\": \\\"2\\\"}, \\\"output\\\": {\\\"oak_fence_gate\\\": \\\"1\\\"}}\\n- {\\\"input\\\": {\\\"oak_planks\\\": \\\"6\\\", \\\"stick\\\": \\\"1\\\"}, \\\"output\\\": {\\\"oak_sign\\\": \\\"3\\\"}}\\n- {\\\"input\\\": {\\\"stick\\\": \\\"1\\\", \\\"iron_ingot\\\": \\\"6\\\"}, \\\"output\\\": {\\\"rail\\\": \\\"16\\\"}}\\n- {\\\"input\\\": {\\\"stick\\\": \\\"2\\\", \\\"#stone_tool_materials\\\": \\\"3\\\"}, \\\"output\\\": {\\\"stone_axe\\\": \\\"1\\\"}}\\n- {\\\"input\\\": {\\\"stick\\\": \\\"2\\\", \\\"#stone_tool_materials\\\": \\\"2\\\"}, \\\"output\\\": {\\\"stone_hoe\\\": \\\"1\\\"}}\\n- {\\\"input\\\": {\\\"stick\\\": \\\"2\\\", \\\"#stone_tool_materials\\\": \\\"3\\\"}, \\\"output\\\": {\\\"stone_pickaxe\\\": \\\"1\\\"}}\\n- {\\\"input\\\": {\\\"stick\\\": \\\"2\\\", \\\"#stone_tool_materials\\\": \\\"1\\\"}, \\\"output\\\": {\\\"stone_shovel\\\": \\\"1\\\"}}\\n- {\\\"input\\\": {\\\"stick\\\": \\\"1\\\", \\\"#stone_tool_materials\\\": \\\"2\\\"}, \\\"output\\\": {\\\"stone_sword\\\": \\\"1\\\"}}\\n- {\\\"input\\\": {\\\"stick\\\": \\\"1\\\", \\\"#coals\\\": \\\"1\\\"}, \\\"output\\\": {\\\"torch\\\": \\\"4\\\"}}\\n- {\\\"input\\\": {\\\"#planks\\\": \\\"1\\\", \\\"iron_ingot\\\": \\\"1\\\", \\\"stick\\\": \\\"1\\\"}, \\\"output\\\": {\\\"tripwire_hook\\\": \\\"2\\\"}}\\n- {\\\"input\\\": {\\\"stick\\\": \\\"2\\\", \\\"#planks\\\": \\\"3\\\"}, \\\"output\\\": {\\\"wooden_axe\\\": \\\"1\\\"}}\\n- {\\\"input\\\": {\\\"stick\\\": \\\"2\\\", \\\"#planks\\\": \\\"2\\\"}, \\\"output\\\": {\\\"wooden_hoe\\\": \\\"1\\\"}}\\n- {\\\"input\\\": {\\\"stick\\\": \\\"2\\\", \\\"#planks\\\": \\\"3\\\"}, \\\"output\\\": {\\\"wooden_pickaxe\\\": \\\"1\\\"}}\\n- {\\\"input\\\": {\\\"stick\\\": \\\"2\\\", \\\"#planks\\\": \\\"1\\\"}, \\\"output\\\": {\\\"wooden_shovel\\\": \\\"1\\\"}}\\n- {\\\"input\\\": {\\\"stick\\\": \\\"1\\\", \\\"#planks\\\": \\\"2\\\"}, \\\"output\\\": {\\\"wooden_sword\\\": \\\"1\\\"}}\\n- {\\\"input\\\": {}, \\\"output\\\": {}}\\n- {\\\"input\\\": {\\\"#planks\\\": \\\"2\\\", \\\"stone_slab\\\": \\\"1\\\", \\\"stick\\\": \\\"2\\\"}, \\\"output\\\": {\\\"grindstone\\\": \\\"1\\\"}}\\n- {\\\"input\\\": {\\\"stick\\\": \\\"6\\\", \\\"smooth_stone_slab\\\": \\\"1\\\"}, \\\"output\\\": {\\\"armor_stand\\\": \\\"1\\\"}}\\nPossible items for the tags (which starts with #, represents a category of items):\\n- #minecraft:planks:\\n    - cherry_planks: 2\\n    - oak_planks: 2\\n- #minecraft:stone_tool_materials:\\n    - cobblestone: 2\\n- #minecraft:coals:\\n    - coal: 1\\n\\nThought: \\n\",\"type\":\"StringPromptValue\"}",
