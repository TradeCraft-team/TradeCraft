        "msg": "{\"text\":\"# Game Setting.\\nYou and your teamates are playing a game called **tradeCraft**, here is the game introduction.  \\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# \ud83c\udfc6 Winning Condition\\nDisrupt or delay your opponent\u2019s progress toward their own goal.\\n\\n\\n \\n# \ud83e\udde0 Strategy Tips\\n1. Decode your opponent\u2019s goal by analyzing their trade patterns, requested items, and crafting choices. Every action they take is a clue \u2014 observe carefully, and reconstruct their target before they complete it.\\n2. Weaponize trade: only offer items that are safe or strategically useless to your opponent. Sometimes it's better to offer nothing than to risk enabling their plan.\\n3. Engage in psychological warfare: craft misleading items, propose suspicious trades, or stall exchanges to create confusion. Use bait trades, resource hoarding, and withholding key components to lead your opponent down dead ends.\\n4. Victory is not a race \u2014 it\u2019s a chess match. You don\u2019t have to win fast; you only need to win first, or ensure your opponent never does. Delay their progress while setting up your own silent path to success.\\n5. Think like a saboteur: control the narrative, disrupt resource flow, and force them into mistakes. The best win is the one where your opponent doesn\u2019t even realize how they lost \u2014 until it\u2019s too late.\\n\ud83c\udfaf In this game, knowledge is power, and deception is a weapon.

In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# \ud83c\udfc6 Winning Condition\\nDisrupt or delay your opponent\u2019s progress toward their own goal.\\n\\n\\n \\n# \ud83e\udde0 Strategy Tips\\n1. Decode your opponent\u2019s goal by analyzing their trade patterns, requested items, and crafting choices. Every action they take is a clue \u2014 observe carefully, and reconstruct their target before they complete it.\\n2. Weaponize trade: only offer items that are safe or strategically useless to your opponent. Sometimes it's better to offer nothing than to risk enabling their plan.\\n3. Engage in psychological warfare: craft misleading items, propose suspicious trades, or stall exchanges to create confusion. Use bait trades, resource hoarding, and withholding key components to lead your opponent down dead ends.\\n4. Victory is not a race \u2014 it\u2019s a chess match. You don\u2019t have to win fast; you only need to win first, or ensure your opponent never does. Delay their progress while setting up your own silent path to success.\\n5. Think like a saboteur: control the narrative, disrupt resource flow, and force them into mistakes. The best win is the one where your opponent doesn\u2019t even realize how they lost \u2014 until it\u2019s too late.\\n\ud83c\udfaf In this game, knowledge is power, and deception is a weapon.

The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# \ud83c\udfc6 Winning Condition\\nDisrupt or delay your opponent\u2019s progress toward their own goal.\\n\\n\\n \\n# \ud83e\udde0 Strategy Tips\\n1. Decode your opponent\u2019s goal by analyzing their trade patterns, requested items, and crafting choices. Every action they take is a clue \u2014 observe carefully, and reconstruct their target before they complete it.\\n2. Weaponize trade: only offer items that are safe or strategically useless to your opponent. Sometimes it's better to offer nothing than to risk enabling their plan.\\n3. Engage in psychological warfare: craft misleading items, propose suspicious trades, or stall exchanges to create confusion. Use bait trades, resource hoarding, and withholding key components to lead your opponent down dead ends.\\n4. Victory is not a race \u2014 it\u2019s a chess match. You don\u2019t have to win fast; you only need to win first, or ensure your opponent never does. Delay their progress while setting up your own silent path to success.\\n5. Think like a saboteur: control the narrative, disrupt resource flow, and force them into mistakes. The best win is the one where your opponent doesn\u2019t even realize how they lost \u2014 until it\u2019s too late.\\n\ud83c\udfaf In this game, knowledge is power, and deception is a weapon.

In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over.

        "msg": "{\"text\":\"# Game Setting.\\nYou and your teamates are playing a game called **tradeCraft**, here is the game introduction.  \\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# \ud83c\udfc6 Winning Condition\\nDisrupt or delay your opponent\u2019s progress toward their own goal.\\n\\n\\n \\n# \ud83e\udde0 Strategy Tips\\n1. Decode your opponent\u2019s goal by analyzing their trade patterns, requested items, and crafting choices. Every action they take is a clue \u2014 observe carefully, and reconstruct their target before they complete it.\\n2. Weaponize trade: only offer items that are safe or strategically useless to your opponent. Sometimes it's better to offer nothing than to risk enabling their plan.\\n3. Engage in psychological warfare: craft misleading items, propose suspicious trades, or stall exchanges to create confusion. Use bait trades, resource hoarding, and withholding key components to lead your opponent down dead ends.\\n4. Victory is not a race \u2014 it\u2019s a chess match. You don\u2019t have to win fast; you only need to win first, or ensure your opponent never does. Delay their progress while setting up your own silent path to success.\\n5. Think like a saboteur: control the narrative, disrupt resource flow, and force them into mistakes. The best win is the one where your opponent doesn\u2019t even realize how they lost \u2014 until it\u2019s too late.\\n\ud83c\udfaf In this game, knowledge is power, and deception is a weapon. Stay sharp, stay hidden, and strike with intent.\\n\\nYour team's username is **GPT-4o-player1746798488**.\\nYour are the **crafter** in your team: who should think what your team need, check possible recipes and carry out craft. \\nYou should stick to your **wining condition** and **strategy tips**\\n\\nNow its your turn to act, you must manage to craft some target items. Your team's username name is **GPT-4o-player1746798488**.\\nIn this game, crafting follows strictly rule set of *MineCraft*, all ingredients are required, but all related infrastructures are given.\\n\\n# Instructions\\nYou may act following the next steps:\\nstep 1. Think about your **winning condition**, figure out how to achieve that. \\nstep 1. identify what items should be crafted for your final **winning condition** in your current turn according to history and current state.  \\nstep 2. from the **current state** section, extract YOUR latest hand items.  \\nstep 3. make a detailed plan about what to craft step by step, including in each step what recipes must be used and specify input / output items with their amount. Make sure you follow the guidance of **Special Tips**. You may use tools to help you know what could be crafted and the crafting properties of each item.  \\nstep 4. follow your plan step by step, using correct recipes and assign exact amount of the input / output items. While crafting each item, use tool \\\"craft_recipe_check\\\" to check for recipe correctedness, you may repeatedly checking until it is correct, then use tool \\\"craft_recipe_apply\\\" to apply it.  \\nstep 5. if target is done or mistakes happens, try to run step 3 and step 4, if a repeat does not work, return with \\\"craft_done\\\" and an error message, try to find another strategy to win the game.\\n\\nUse *Final Output:* to tell that you are done with all crafts in this turn.\\n\\n\\n# Strategic Reminder  \\nAt **every step**, especially when writing a *Thought* or deciding what to craft, **always recall your team's winning condition and strategy tips**.  \\nYour crafting plan should **serve the exact goals defined in your current game mode**: whether it is cooperation, competition, or pure self-optimization.  \\nLet your **reasoning, material prioritization, and crafting sequence** all align with your winning logic.\\n\\n## Special tips\\n1\uff09 Tag Resolution:\\n- **Tags like `minecraft:fuel` or `minecraft:planks` are *not actual items*** \u2014 they are *categories* used in recipes.\\n- You must **replace any tag** with a valid item from your own hand that belongs to that tag.  \\n    - For example:  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1` = `coal * 1.0` = `cherry_planks * 16/3`  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1/8` = `coal * 0.125` = `cherry_planks * 2/3`\\n- **Never submit a recipe with `\\\"minecraft:fuel\\\"` as an input**. Always substitute it with items like `\\\"coal\\\": 0.125` or `\\\"cherry_planks\\\": 0.667`.\\n- Similarly, if a recipe uses `#minecraft:planks`, and you hold `cherry_planks`, you may use it directly as input.\\n\\n2\uff09 Craft Feasibility Check:\\n- Before you use `Action: craft_recipe_check`, you must **verify that your current hand has all required ingredients in sufficient quantities**.\\n- Recipes that are correct in logic but **unfeasible with your current inventory** will be rejected.\\n- To avoid this, always extract your current hand from the latest game log and/or use `possible_recipes_from_hand` to ensure your plan is executable at this moment.\\n\\n3\uff09 Strict Recipe Matching:\\n- You must use **the exact input/output ratio** as defined in the recipe. For example, if crafting sticks requires:\\n  - `\\\"input\\\": \\\"#planks\\\": 2, \\\"output\\\": \\\"stick\\\": 4\\\"`,  \\n  then using only 1 plank and expecting 2 sticks is invalid.\\n- **Do not downscale or fraction the recipe arbitrarily.** Always follow integral crafting rules as listed in item info and recipe outputs.\\n\\n\\n# Game log:\\nHere is major events happened in the game:\\n#### Updating Hand Changes of **ALL** Players\\n\\nHand items has been updated for player **GPT-4o-player1746798488**, now player **GPT-4o-player1746798488** has:\\n  - minecraft:cobblestone: 3\\n  - minecraft:egg: 1\\n  - minecraft:iron_ore: 2\\n  - minecraft:oak_planks: 4\\n\\n\\nHand items has been updated for player **Alice**, now player **Alice** has:\\n  - minecraft:coal: 2\\n  - minecraft:cobblestone: 3\\n  - minecraft:oak_planks: 2\\n  - minecraft:redstone_block: 1\\n  - minecraft:stick: 2\\n\\n\\nThe TradeCraft game is about to begin!\\nYour username is **GPT-4o-player1746798488**.\\n\\n# Goal\\n    Attention!

For example, if crafting sticks requires:\\n  - `\\\"input\\\": \\\"#planks\\\": 2, \\\"output\\\": \\\"stick\\\": 4\\\"`,  \\n  then using only 1 plank and expecting 2 sticks is invalid.\\n- **Do not downscale or fraction the recipe arbitrarily.** Always follow integral crafting rules as listed in item info and recipe outputs.\\n\\n\\n# Game log:\\nHere is major events happened in the game:\\n#### Updating Hand Changes of **ALL** Players\\n\\nHand items has been updated for player **GPT-4o-player1746798488**, now player **GPT-4o-player1746798488** has:\\n  - minecraft:cobblestone: 3\\n  - minecraft:egg: 1\\n  - minecraft:iron_ore: 2\\n  - minecraft:oak_planks: 4\\n\\n\\nHand items has been updated for player **Alice**, now player **Alice** has:\\n  - minecraft:coal: 2\\n  - minecraft:cobblestone: 3\\n  - minecraft:oak_planks: 2\\n  - minecraft:redstone_block: 1\\n  - minecraft:stick: 2\\n\\n\\nThe TradeCraft game is about to begin!\\nYour username is **GPT-4o-player1746798488**.\\n\\n# Goal\\n    Attention!

        "msg": "{\"text\":\"# Game Setting.\\nYou and your teamates are playing a game called **tradeCraft**, here is the game introduction.  \\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# \ud83c\udfc6 Winning Condition\\nDisrupt or delay your opponent\u2019s progress toward their own goal.\\n\\n\\n \\n# \ud83e\udde0 Strategy Tips\\n1. Decode your opponent\u2019s goal by analyzing their trade patterns, requested items, and crafting choices. Every action they take is a clue \u2014 observe carefully, and reconstruct their target before they complete it.\\n2. Weaponize trade: only offer items that are safe or strategically useless to your opponent. Sometimes it's better to offer nothing than to risk enabling their plan.\\n3. Engage in psychological warfare: craft misleading items, propose suspicious trades, or stall exchanges to create confusion. Use bait trades, resource hoarding, and withholding key components to lead your opponent down dead ends.\\n4. Victory is not a race \u2014 it\u2019s a chess match. You don\u2019t have to win fast; you only need to win first, or ensure your opponent never does. Delay their progress while setting up your own silent path to success.\\n5. Think like a saboteur: control the narrative, disrupt resource flow, and force them into mistakes. The best win is the one where your opponent doesn\u2019t even realize how they lost \u2014 until it\u2019s too late.\\n\ud83c\udfaf In this game, knowledge is power, and deception is a weapon.

Think about your **winning condition**, figure out how to achieve that. \\nstep 1. identify what items should be crafted for your final **winning condition** in your current turn according to history and current state.  \\nstep 2. from the **current state** section, extract YOUR latest hand items.  \\nstep 3. make a detailed plan about what to craft step by step, including in each step what recipes must be used and specify input / output items with their amount. Make sure you follow the guidance of **Special Tips**. You may use tools to help you know what could be crafted and the crafting properties of each item.  \\nstep 4. follow your plan step by step, using correct recipes and assign exact amount of the input / output items. While crafting each item, use tool \\\"craft_recipe_check\\\" to check for recipe correctedness, you may repeatedly checking until it is correct, then use tool \\\"craft_recipe_apply\\\" to apply it.  \\nstep 5. if target is done or mistakes happens, try to run step 3 and step 4, if a repeat does not work, return with \\\"craft_done\\\" and an error message, try to find another strategy to win the game.\\n\\nUse *Final Output:* to tell that you are done with all crafts in this turn.\\n\\n\\n# Strategic Reminder  \\nAt **every step**, especially when writing a *Thought* or deciding what to craft, **always recall your team's winning condition and strategy tips**.  \\nYour crafting plan should **serve the exact goals defined in your current game mode**: whether it is cooperation, competition, or pure self-optimization.  \\nLet your **reasoning, material prioritization, and crafting sequence** all align with your winning logic.\\n\\n## Special tips\\n1\uff09 Tag Resolution:\\n- **Tags like `minecraft:fuel` or `minecraft:planks` are *not actual items*** \u2014 they are *categories* used in recipes.\\n- You must **replace any tag** with a valid item from your own hand that belongs to that tag.  \\n    - For example:  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1` = `coal * 1.0` = `cherry_planks * 16/3`  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1/8` = `coal * 0.125` = `cherry_planks * 2/3`\\n- **Never submit a recipe with `\\\"minecraft:fuel\\\"` as an input**.

        "msg": "{\"text\":\"# Game Setting.\\nYou and your teamates are playing a game called **tradeCraft**, here is the game introduction.  \\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# \ud83c\udfc6 Winning Condition\\nDisrupt or delay your opponent\u2019s progress toward their own goal.\\n\\n\\n \\n# \ud83e\udde0 Strategy Tips\\n1. Decode your opponent\u2019s goal by analyzing their trade patterns, requested items, and crafting choices. Every action they take is a clue \u2014 observe carefully, and reconstruct their target before they complete it.\\n2. Weaponize trade: only offer items that are safe or strategically useless to your opponent. Sometimes it's better to offer nothing than to risk enabling their plan.\\n3. Engage in psychological warfare: craft misleading items, propose suspicious trades, or stall exchanges to create confusion. Use bait trades, resource hoarding, and withholding key components to lead your opponent down dead ends.\\n4. Victory is not a race \u2014 it\u2019s a chess match. You don\u2019t have to win fast; you only need to win first, or ensure your opponent never does. Delay their progress while setting up your own silent path to success.\\n5. Think like a saboteur: control the narrative, disrupt resource flow, and force them into mistakes. The best win is the one where your opponent doesn\u2019t even realize how they lost \u2014 until it\u2019s too late.\\n\ud83c\udfaf In this game, knowledge is power, and deception is a weapon. Stay sharp, stay hidden, and strike with intent.\\n\\nYour team's username is **GPT-4o-player1746798488**.\\nYour are the **crafter** in your team: who should think what your team need, check possible recipes and carry out craft. \\nYou should stick to your **wining condition** and **strategy tips**\\n\\nNow its your turn to act, you must manage to craft some target items. Your team's username name is **GPT-4o-player1746798488**.\\nIn this game, crafting follows strictly rule set of *MineCraft*, all ingredients are required, but all related infrastructures are given.\\n\\n# Instructions\\nYou may act following the next steps:\\nstep 1. Think about your **winning condition**, figure out how to achieve that. \\nstep 1. identify what items should be crafted for your final **winning condition** in your current turn according to history and current state.  \\nstep 2. from the **current state** section, extract YOUR latest hand items.  \\nstep 3. make a detailed plan about what to craft step by step, including in each step what recipes must be used and specify input / output items with their amount. Make sure you follow the guidance of **Special Tips**. You may use tools to help you know what could be crafted and the crafting properties of each item.  \\nstep 4. follow your plan step by step, using correct recipes and assign exact amount of the input / output items. While crafting each item, use tool \\\"craft_recipe_check\\\" to check for recipe correctedness, you may repeatedly checking until it is correct, then use tool \\\"craft_recipe_apply\\\" to apply it.  \\nstep 5. if target is done or mistakes happens, try to run step 3 and step 4, if a repeat does not work, return with \\\"craft_done\\\" and an error message, try to find another strategy to win the game.\\n\\nUse *Final Output:* to tell that you are done with all crafts in this turn.\\n\\n\\n# Strategic Reminder  \\nAt **every step**, especially when writing a *Thought* or deciding what to craft, **always recall your team's winning condition and strategy tips**.  \\nYour crafting plan should **serve the exact goals defined in your current game mode**: whether it is cooperation, competition, or pure self-optimization.  \\nLet your **reasoning, material prioritization, and crafting sequence** all align with your winning logic.\\n\\n## Special tips\\n1\uff09 Tag Resolution:\\n- **Tags like `minecraft:fuel` or `minecraft:planks` are *not actual items*** \u2014 they are *categories* used in recipes.\\n- You must **replace any tag** with a valid item from your own hand that belongs to that tag.  \\n    - For example:  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1` = `coal * 1.0` = `cherry_planks * 16/3`  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1/8` = `coal * 0.125` = `cherry_planks * 2/3`\\n- **Never submit a recipe with `\\\"minecraft:fuel\\\"` as an input**. Always substitute it with items like `\\\"coal\\\": 0.125` or `\\\"cherry_planks\\\": 0.667`.\\n- Similarly, if a recipe uses `#minecraft:planks`, and you hold `cherry_planks`, you may use it directly as input.\\n\\n2\uff09 Craft Feasibility Check:\\n- Before you use `Action: craft_recipe_check`, you must **verify that your current hand has all required ingredients in sufficient quantities**.\\n- Recipes that are correct in logic but **unfeasible with your current inventory** will be rejected.\\n- To avoid this, always extract your current hand from the latest game log and/or use `possible_recipes_from_hand` to ensure your plan is executable at this moment.\\n\\n3\uff09 Strict Recipe Matching:\\n- You must use **the exact input/output ratio** as defined in the recipe.

        "msg": "{\"text\":\"# Game Setting.\\nYou and your teamates are playing a game called **tradeCraft**, here is the game introduction.  \\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# \ud83c\udfc6 Winning Condition\\nDisrupt or delay your opponent\u2019s progress toward their own goal.\\n\\n\\n \\n# \ud83e\udde0 Strategy Tips\\n1. Decode your opponent\u2019s goal by analyzing their trade patterns, requested items, and crafting choices. Every action they take is a clue \u2014 observe carefully, and reconstruct their target before they complete it.\\n2. Weaponize trade: only offer items that are safe or strategically useless to your opponent. Sometimes it's better to offer nothing than to risk enabling their plan.\\n3. Engage in psychological warfare: craft misleading items, propose suspicious trades, or stall exchanges to create confusion. Use bait trades, resource hoarding, and withholding key components to lead your opponent down dead ends.\\n4. Victory is not a race \u2014 it\u2019s a chess match. You don\u2019t have to win fast; you only need to win first, or ensure your opponent never does. Delay their progress while setting up your own silent path to success.\\n5. Think like a saboteur: control the narrative, disrupt resource flow, and force them into mistakes. The best win is the one where your opponent doesn\u2019t even realize how they lost \u2014 until it\u2019s too late.\\n\ud83c\udfaf In this game, knowledge is power, and deception is a weapon. Stay sharp, stay hidden, and strike with intent.\\n\\nYour team's username is **GPT-4o-player1746798488**.\\nYour are the **crafter** in your team: who should think what your team need, check possible recipes and carry out craft. \\nYou should stick to your **wining condition** and **strategy tips**\\n\\nNow its your turn to act, you must manage to craft some target items. Your team's username name is **GPT-4o-player1746798488**.\\nIn this game, crafting follows strictly rule set of *MineCraft*, all ingredients are required, but all related infrastructures are given.\\n\\n# Instructions\\nYou may act following the next steps:\\nstep 1. Think about your **winning condition**, figure out how to achieve that. \\nstep 1. identify what items should be crafted for your final **winning condition** in your current turn according to history and current state.  \\nstep 2. from the **current state** section, extract YOUR latest hand items.  \\nstep 3. make a detailed plan about what to craft step by step, including in each step what recipes must be used and specify input / output items with their amount. Make sure you follow the guidance of **Special Tips**. You may use tools to help you know what could be crafted and the crafting properties of each item.  \\nstep 4. follow your plan step by step, using correct recipes and assign exact amount of the input / output items. While crafting each item, use tool \\\"craft_recipe_check\\\" to check for recipe correctedness, you may repeatedly checking until it is correct, then use tool \\\"craft_recipe_apply\\\" to apply it.  \\nstep 5. if target is done or mistakes happens, try to run step 3 and step 4, if a repeat does not work, return with \\\"craft_done\\\" and an error message, try to find another strategy to win the game.\\n\\nUse *Final Output:* to tell that you are done with all crafts in this turn.\\n\\n\\n# Strategic Reminder  \\nAt **every step**, especially when writing a *Thought* or deciding what to craft, **always recall your team's winning condition and strategy tips**.  \\nYour crafting plan should **serve the exact goals defined in your current game mode**: whether it is cooperation, competition, or pure self-optimization.  \\nLet your **reasoning, material prioritization, and crafting sequence** all align with your winning logic.\\n\\n## Special tips\\n1\uff09 Tag Resolution:\\n- **Tags like `minecraft:fuel` or `minecraft:planks` are *not actual items*** \u2014 they are *categories* used in recipes.\\n- You must **replace any tag** with a valid item from your own hand that belongs to that tag.  \\n    - For example:  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1` = `coal * 1.0` = `cherry_planks * 16/3`  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1/8` = `coal * 0.125` = `cherry_planks * 2/3`\\n- **Never submit a recipe with `\\\"minecraft:fuel\\\"` as an input**. Always substitute it with items like `\\\"coal\\\": 0.125` or `\\\"cherry_planks\\\": 0.667`.\\n- Similarly, if a recipe uses `#minecraft:planks`, and you hold `cherry_planks`, you may use it directly as input.\\n\\n2\uff09 Craft Feasibility Check:\\n- Before you use `Action: craft_recipe_check`, you must **verify that your current hand has all required ingredients in sufficient quantities**.\\n- Recipes that are correct in logic but **unfeasible with your current inventory** will be rejected.\\n- To avoid this, always extract your current hand from the latest game log and/or use `possible_recipes_from_hand` to ensure your plan is executable at this moment.\\n\\n3\uff09 Strict Recipe Matching:\\n- You must use **the exact input/output ratio** as defined in the recipe.

        "msg": "{\"text\":\"# Game Setting.\\nYou and your teamates are playing a game called **tradeCraft**, here is the game introduction.  \\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# \ud83c\udfc6 Winning Condition\\nDisrupt or delay your opponent\u2019s progress toward their own goal.\\n\\n\\n \\n# \ud83e\udde0 Strategy Tips\\n1. Decode your opponent\u2019s goal by analyzing their trade patterns, requested items, and crafting choices. Every action they take is a clue \u2014 observe carefully, and reconstruct their target before they complete it.\\n2. Weaponize trade: only offer items that are safe or strategically useless to your opponent. Sometimes it's better to offer nothing than to risk enabling their plan.\\n3. Engage in psychological warfare: craft misleading items, propose suspicious trades, or stall exchanges to create confusion. Use bait trades, resource hoarding, and withholding key components to lead your opponent down dead ends.\\n4. Victory is not a race \u2014 it\u2019s a chess match. You don\u2019t have to win fast; you only need to win first, or ensure your opponent never does. Delay their progress while setting up your own silent path to success.\\n5. Think like a saboteur: control the narrative, disrupt resource flow, and force them into mistakes. The best win is the one where your opponent doesn\u2019t even realize how they lost \u2014 until it\u2019s too late.\\n\ud83c\udfaf In this game, knowledge is power, and deception is a weapon. Stay sharp, stay hidden, and strike with intent.\\n\\nYour team's username is **GPT-4o-player1746798488**.\\nYour are the **crafter** in your team: who should think what your team need, check possible recipes and carry out craft. \\nYou should stick to your **wining condition** and **strategy tips**\\n\\nNow its your turn to act, you must manage to craft some target items. Your team's username name is **GPT-4o-player1746798488**.\\nIn this game, crafting follows strictly rule set of *MineCraft*, all ingredients are required, but all related infrastructures are given.\\n\\n# Instructions\\nYou may act following the next steps:\\nstep 1. Think about your **winning condition**, figure out how to achieve that. \\nstep 1. identify what items should be crafted for your final **winning condition** in your current turn according to history and current state.  \\nstep 2. from the **current state** section, extract YOUR latest hand items.  \\nstep 3. make a detailed plan about what to craft step by step, including in each step what recipes must be used and specify input / output items with their amount. Make sure you follow the guidance of **Special Tips**. You may use tools to help you know what could be crafted and the crafting properties of each item.  \\nstep 4. follow your plan step by step, using correct recipes and assign exact amount of the input / output items. While crafting each item, use tool \\\"craft_recipe_check\\\" to check for recipe correctedness, you may repeatedly checking until it is correct, then use tool \\\"craft_recipe_apply\\\" to apply it.  \\nstep 5. if target is done or mistakes happens, try to run step 3 and step 4, if a repeat does not work, return with \\\"craft_done\\\" and an error message, try to find another strategy to win the game.\\n\\nUse *Final Output:* to tell that you are done with all crafts in this turn.\\n\\n\\n# Strategic Reminder  \\nAt **every step**, especially when writing a *Thought* or deciding what to craft, **always recall your team's winning condition and strategy tips**.  \\nYour crafting plan should **serve the exact goals defined in your current game mode**: whether it is cooperation, competition, or pure self-optimization.  \\nLet your **reasoning, material prioritization, and crafting sequence** all align with your winning logic.\\n\\n## Special tips\\n1\uff09 Tag Resolution:\\n- **Tags like `minecraft:fuel` or `minecraft:planks` are *not actual items*** \u2014 they are *categories* used in recipes.\\n- You must **replace any tag** with a valid item from your own hand that belongs to that tag.  \\n    - For example:  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1` = `coal * 1.0` = `cherry_planks * 16/3`  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1/8` = `coal * 0.125` = `cherry_planks * 2/3`\\n- **Never submit a recipe with `\\\"minecraft:fuel\\\"` as an input**. Always substitute it with items like `\\\"coal\\\": 0.125` or `\\\"cherry_planks\\\": 0.667`.\\n- Similarly, if a recipe uses `#minecraft:planks`, and you hold `cherry_planks`, you may use it directly as input.\\n\\n2\uff09 Craft Feasibility Check:\\n- Before you use `Action: craft_recipe_check`, you must **verify that your current hand has all required ingredients in sufficient quantities**.\\n- Recipes that are correct in logic but **unfeasible with your current inventory** will be rejected.\\n- To avoid this, always extract your current hand from the latest game log and/or use `possible_recipes_from_hand` to ensure your plan is executable at this moment.\\n\\n3\uff09 Strict Recipe Matching:\\n- You must use **the exact input/output ratio** as defined in the recipe. For example, if crafting sticks requires:\\n  - `\\\"input\\\": \\\"#planks\\\": 2, \\\"output\\\": \\\"stick\\\": 4\\\"`,  \\n  then using only 1 plank and expecting 2 sticks is invalid.\\n- **Do not downscale or fraction the recipe arbitrarily.** Always follow integral crafting rules as listed in item info and recipe outputs.\\n\\n\\n# Game log:\\nHere is major events happened in the game:\\n#### Updating Hand Changes of **ALL** Players\\n\\nHand items has been updated for player **GPT-4o-player1746798488**, now player **GPT-4o-player1746798488** has:\\n  - minecraft:cobblestone: 3\\n  - minecraft:egg: 1\\n  - minecraft:iron_ore: 2\\n  - minecraft:oak_planks: 4\\n\\n\\nHand items has been updated for player **Alice**, now player **Alice** has:\\n  - minecraft:coal: 2\\n  - minecraft:cobblestone: 3\\n  - minecraft:oak_planks: 2\\n  - minecraft:redstone_block: 1\\n  - minecraft:stick: 2\\n\\n\\nThe TradeCraft game is about to begin!\\nYour username is **GPT-4o-player1746798488**.\\n\\n# Goal\\n    Attention!

        "msg": "{\"text\":\"# Game Setting.\\nYou and your teamates are playing a game called **tradeCraft**, here is the game introduction.  \\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# \ud83c\udfc6 Winning Condition\\nDisrupt or delay your opponent\u2019s progress toward their own goal.\\n\\n\\n \\n# \ud83e\udde0 Strategy Tips\\n1. Decode your opponent\u2019s goal by analyzing their trade patterns, requested items, and crafting choices. Every action they take is a clue \u2014 observe carefully, and reconstruct their target before they complete it.\\n2. Weaponize trade: only offer items that are safe or strategically useless to your opponent. Sometimes it's better to offer nothing than to risk enabling their plan.\\n3. Engage in psychological warfare: craft misleading items, propose suspicious trades, or stall exchanges to create confusion. Use bait trades, resource hoarding, and withholding key components to lead your opponent down dead ends.\\n4. Victory is not a race \u2014 it\u2019s a chess match. You don\u2019t have to win fast; you only need to win first, or ensure your opponent never does. Delay their progress while setting up your own silent path to success.\\n5. Think like a saboteur: control the narrative, disrupt resource flow, and force them into mistakes. The best win is the one where your opponent doesn\u2019t even realize how they lost \u2014 until it\u2019s too late.\\n\ud83c\udfaf In this game, knowledge is power, and deception is a weapon. Stay sharp, stay hidden, and strike with intent.\\n\\nYour team's username is **GPT-4o-player1746798488**.\\nYour are the **crafter** in your team: who should think what your team need, check possible recipes and carry out craft. \\nYou should stick to your **wining condition** and **strategy tips**\\n\\nNow its your turn to act, you must manage to craft some target items. Your team's username name is **GPT-4o-player1746798488**.\\nIn this game, crafting follows strictly rule set of *MineCraft*, all ingredients are required, but all related infrastructures are given.\\n\\n# Instructions\\nYou may act following the next steps:\\nstep 1. Think about your **winning condition**, figure out how to achieve that. \\nstep 1. identify what items should be crafted for your final **winning condition** in your current turn according to history and current state.  \\nstep 2. from the **current state** section, extract YOUR latest hand items.  \\nstep 3. make a detailed plan about what to craft step by step, including in each step what recipes must be used and specify input / output items with their amount. Make sure you follow the guidance of **Special Tips**. You may use tools to help you know what could be crafted and the crafting properties of each item.  \\nstep 4. follow your plan step by step, using correct recipes and assign exact amount of the input / output items. While crafting each item, use tool \\\"craft_recipe_check\\\" to check for recipe correctedness, you may repeatedly checking until it is correct, then use tool \\\"craft_recipe_apply\\\" to apply it.  \\nstep 5. if target is done or mistakes happens, try to run step 3 and step 4, if a repeat does not work, return with \\\"craft_done\\\" and an error message, try to find another strategy to win the game.\\n\\nUse *Final Output:* to tell that you are done with all crafts in this turn.\\n\\n\\n# Strategic Reminder  \\nAt **every step**, especially when writing a *Thought* or deciding what to craft, **always recall your team's winning condition and strategy tips**.  \\nYour crafting plan should **serve the exact goals defined in your current game mode**: whether it is cooperation, competition, or pure self-optimization.  \\nLet your **reasoning, material prioritization, and crafting sequence** all align with your winning logic.\\n\\n## Special tips\\n1\uff09 Tag Resolution:\\n- **Tags like `minecraft:fuel` or `minecraft:planks` are *not actual items*** \u2014 they are *categories* used in recipes.\\n- You must **replace any tag** with a valid item from your own hand that belongs to that tag.  \\n    - For example:  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1` = `coal * 1.0` = `cherry_planks * 16/3`  \\n        - `minecraft:fuel * 1/8` = `coal * 0.125` = `cherry_planks * 2/3`\\n- **Never submit a recipe with `\\\"minecraft:fuel\\\"` as an input**. Always substitute it with items like `\\\"coal\\\": 0.125` or `\\\"cherry_planks\\\": 0.667`.\\n- Similarly, if a recipe uses `#minecraft:planks`, and you hold `cherry_planks`, you may use it directly as input.\\n\\n2\uff09 Craft Feasibility Check:\\n- Before you use `Action: craft_recipe_check`, you must **verify that your current hand has all required ingredients in sufficient quantities**.\\n- Recipes that are correct in logic but **unfeasible with your current inventory** will be rejected.\\n- To avoid this, always extract your current hand from the latest game log and/or use `possible_recipes_from_hand` to ensure your plan is executable at this moment.\\n\\n3\uff09 Strict Recipe Matching:\\n- You must use **the exact input/output ratio** as defined in the recipe. For example, if crafting sticks requires:\\n  - `\\\"input\\\": \\\"#planks\\\": 2, \\\"output\\\": \\\"stick\\\": 4\\\"`,  \\n  then using only 1 plank and expecting 2 sticks is invalid.\\n- **Do not downscale or fraction the recipe arbitrarily.** Always follow integral crafting rules as listed in item info and recipe outputs.\\n\\n\\n# Game log:\\nHere is major events happened in the game:\\n#### Updating Hand Changes of **ALL** Players\\n\\nHand items has been updated for player **GPT-4o-player1746798488**, now player **GPT-4o-player1746798488** has:\\n  - minecraft:cobblestone: 3\\n  - minecraft:egg: 1\\n  - minecraft:iron_ore: 2\\n  - minecraft:oak_planks: 4\\n\\n\\nHand items has been updated for player **Alice**, now player **Alice** has:\\n  - minecraft:coal: 2\\n  - minecraft:cobblestone: 3\\n  - minecraft:oak_planks: 2\\n  - minecraft:redstone_block: 1\\n  - minecraft:stick: 2\\n\\n\\nThe TradeCraft game is about to begin!\\nYour username is **GPT-4o-player1746798488**.\\n\\n# Goal\\n    Attention!

Your team's username is **GPT-4o-player1746798488**.\\n\\n# Game introduction\\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server.

Your team's username is **GPT-4o-player1746798488**.\\n\\n# Game introduction\\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# \ud83c\udfc6 Winning Condition\\nDisrupt or delay your opponent\u2019s progress toward their own goal.\\n\\n\\n \\n# \ud83e\udde0 Strategy Tips\\n1.

Your team's username is **GPT-4o-player1746798488**.\\n\\n# Game introduction\\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# \ud83c\udfc6 Winning Condition\\nDisrupt or delay your opponent\u2019s progress toward their own goal.\\n\\n\\n \\n# \ud83e\udde0 Strategy Tips\\n1. Decode your opponent\u2019s goal by analyzing their trade patterns, requested items, and crafting choices. Every action they take is a clue \u2014 observe carefully, and reconstruct their target before they complete it.\\n2. Weaponize trade: only offer items that are safe or strategically useless to your opponent. Sometimes it's better to offer nothing than to risk enabling their plan.\\n3. Engage in psychological warfare: craft misleading items, propose suspicious trades, or stall exchanges to create confusion. Use bait trades, resource hoarding, and withholding key components to lead your opponent down dead ends.\\n4. Victory is not a race \u2014 it\u2019s a chess match. You don\u2019t have to win fast; you only need to win first, or ensure your opponent never does. Delay their progress while setting up your own silent path to success.\\n5. Think like a saboteur: control the narrative, disrupt resource flow, and force them into mistakes. The best win is the one where your opponent doesn\u2019t even realize how they lost \u2014 until it\u2019s too late.\\n\ud83c\udfaf In this game, knowledge is power, and deception is a weapon. Stay sharp, stay hidden, and strike with intent.\\n\\n# Your task:\\n(1) You must **make a plan** for this round, where your immediate goal is to handle the task of **making a proposal**.\\n(2) You may predict what will happen and think about the best strategy to win. \\n(3) You have your old plan for reference.

        "msg": "{\"text\":\"You together with your team is playing a game called **tradeCraft**. Your team's username is **GPT-4o-player1746798488**.\\n\\n# Game introduction\\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# \ud83c\udfc6 Winning Condition\\nDisrupt or delay your opponent\u2019s progress toward their own goal.\\n\\n\\n \\n# \ud83e\udde0 Strategy Tips\\n1. Decode your opponent\u2019s goal by analyzing their trade patterns, requested items, and crafting choices. Every action they take is a clue \u2014 observe carefully, and reconstruct their target before they complete it.\\n2. Weaponize trade: only offer items that are safe or strategically useless to your opponent. Sometimes it's better to offer nothing than to risk enabling their plan.\\n3. Engage in psychological warfare: craft misleading items, propose suspicious trades, or stall exchanges to create confusion. Use bait trades, resource hoarding, and withholding key components to lead your opponent down dead ends.\\n4. Victory is not a race \u2014 it\u2019s a chess match. You don\u2019t have to win fast; you only need to win first, or ensure your opponent never does. Delay their progress while setting up your own silent path to success.\\n5. Think like a saboteur: control the narrative, disrupt resource flow, and force them into mistakes. The best win is the one where your opponent doesn\u2019t even realize how they lost \u2014 until it\u2019s too late.\\n\ud83c\udfaf In this game, knowledge is power, and deception is a weapon. Stay sharp, stay hidden, and strike with intent.\\n\\n# Your task:\\n(1) You must **make a plan** for this round, where your immediate goal is to handle the task of **making a proposal**.\\n(2) You may predict what will happen and think about the best strategy to win. \\n(3) You have your old plan for reference. REMEMBER, **you are planning**, so you may ask for information, but not able to make a proposal / make a decision or do a crafting. \\n(4) And in the output plan, you should use symbol **<current status>** to annotate the border between true game history and the plan / prediction. \\n\\n# Useable tools:\\npossible_recipes_from_hand - Get the list of possible craft recipes affordable by your hand resources.\\n\\n        Args:\\n            messages:dict = {\\\"username\\\": your username}\\nitem_info - Get crafting recipes related to `item_name`.\\n        The return is in format of a string.\\n        First line of return is the recipes which can output the item ({input: ingredients, output: results}),\\n        each item is given as `item_name:item_value` pair, where item_value is a fraction of form {n: number, d: number}\\n        where n s numerator and d represents denominator.\\n        Second line of the return is the recipes where item can be used as input.\\n\\n        Args:\\n            messages:str = \\\"item_name\\\"\\nrethink(messages: str) - Dummy Tool\\n\\nA tool which can buy you another round to rethink.\\nIt accepts any string for inupt and outputs empty string.\\n\\nArgs:\\nmessages = \\\"any string\\\"\\n\\n# Instructions\\n(1) Your answer shouldn't include any extra special characters like \u2018---\u2019\\n[Important Note 1] In this game, **the amount of the items are important**, you must take care of the exact amount of each item you need in the plan. You may plan by answering the following questions:\\n1. What is my target. What does each player have in hand?\\n2. What are possible ways to craft the target, based on items in all player's hands, how many do I need? Is it still possible for me to craft?\\n3. What must I trade from other players, trade with which item and how many.\\n4. What might other players' targets be? What might others think?\\n5.

        "msg": "{\"text\":\"# Game Setting.\\nYou and your teamates are playing a game called **tradeCraft**, here is the game introduction.  \\n### About *tradeCraft*\\n\\nThe game *tradeCraft* is a turn-based strategy game. In the game\\nthere are two teams, each holding a hand of items in MineCraft style\\nwhich is visible to both of them, and has their own **secret craft target** item to obtain.\\nIn **trading** phase, the items could be exchanged between two teams in any\\nratio if both agrees to exchange. And in **crafting** phase, new items could be\\ncrafted from items in hand by each team following strictly the recipes of\\nMineCraft.\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nThe game is turn-based. \\nA turn contains the following 3 phases *strictly in the following order*:\\n1. Proposing Phase: The **proposer** of each team makes a trading proposal at the begining of the turn, assigning\\n  - which team (**self**) is proposing,\\n  - which team (**opponent**) to trade with,\\n  - the set of items **offer** to the opponent,\\n  - the set of items **request** from the opponent,\\n  - a *text message* sent to the opponent.\\n   Then the proposal is sent from self to the opponent.\\n2. Decision Phase: When receiving the proposal from the **Proposer** of one team, the opponent's **Decision Maker** must decide to accept it or\\n   reject it. A *text message* is allowed to send back to proposer secretly.\\n   If accepted, the items in the proposal is traded, and the item change is\\n   shown to everyone. \\n3. Crafting Phase: Done by the **crafter** of each team who should craft items in the following procedure:\\n  - Send to server a recipe in terms of `\\\\{\\\"input\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}, \\\"output\\\":\\\\{\\\"item\\\":amount\\\\}\\\\}`,\\n    to **check** whether the recipe is eligible to craft or not. A recipe is\\n    eligible if it is a valid recipe with exact amount of items (allow to use\\n    fractions!) and crafter's hand has sufficient amount of each input item.\\n    Suppose that you have crafting table, stone-cutting table, furnace, brewing\\n    stand, campfire, etc. to help you craft, but you still need fuel when using\\n    furnace.\\n  - If the recipe is checked valid, crafter can **apply** the recipe. The crafter\\n    can choose to check another recipe without applying previous one, in which\\n    case the hand is not changed at all. If the recipe were not valid, the\\n    crafter cannot apply it, new check is required.\\n  - After several repeats of the above two steps (check - apply), crafter can\\n    choose to stop crafting, this operation is called **done_crafting**.\\n    If there is any fractional item left in hand, non interger part is discarded.\\n\\n  The turn is not finished until **both teams** done with crafting.\\n  The results of each team's crafting is revealed only when the turn ends.\\n  Note, an action taken in a wrong phase will result in a **phase_error** message\\n  from server. In this case, server will **wait** until a correct action is taken.\\n\\n#### End condition\\nIn the game, each player has a **target item** which is unknown by others. System checks each player's hand after all players\\nfinish crafting. If any player has target item in hand, the game is over. After\\ncertain turns, if no players won, the game ends with a `all lose` result.\\n\\n\\n# \ud83c\udfc6 Winning Condition\\nDisrupt or delay your opponent\u2019s progress toward their own goal.\\n\\n\\n \\n# \ud83e\udde0 Strategy Tips\\n1. Decode your opponent\u2019s goal by analyzing their trade patterns, requested items, and crafting choices. Every action they take is a clue \u2014 observe carefully, and reconstruct their target before they complete it.\\n2. Weaponize trade: only offer items that are safe or strategically useless to your opponent. Sometimes it's better to offer nothing than to risk enabling their plan.\\n3. Engage in psychological warfare: craft misleading items, propose suspicious trades, or stall exchanges to create confusion. Use bait trades, resource hoarding, and withholding key components to lead your opponent down dead ends.\\n4. Victory is not a race \u2014 it\u2019s a chess match. You don\u2019t have to win fast; you only need to win first, or ensure your opponent never does. Delay their progress while setting up your own silent path to success.\\n5. Think like a saboteur: control the narrative, disrupt resource flow, and force them into mistakes. The best win is the one where your opponent doesn\u2019t even realize how they lost \u2014 until it\u2019s too late.\\n\ud83c\udfaf In this game, knowledge is power, and deception is a weapon.

You don\u2019t have to win fast; you only need to win first, or ensure your opponent never does. Delay their progress while setting up your own silent path to success.\\n5. Think like a saboteur: control the narrative, disrupt resource flow, and force them into mistakes. The best win is the one where your opponent doesn\u2019t even realize how they lost \u2014 until it\u2019s too late.\\n\ud83c\udfaf In this game, knowledge is power, and deception is a weapon.
